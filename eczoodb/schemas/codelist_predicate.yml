#
# A <codelist_predicate> is an object that specifies a condition (which may be
# composed of multiple conditions) that a code must satisfy to be included in
# a code list.
#


_description: >-
  A collection of predicates used to specify which codes should be included in
  a code list page.  Predicates specified together as different keys in this
  object combine with "AND" logic, i.e., all the predicate keys given by the user
  in this object instance need to be satisfied for a code to be included in
  the codes collected by this predicate collection.
