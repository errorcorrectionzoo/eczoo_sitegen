We also provide a complete detailed description of the structure of the algorithm, which should be sufficient for anyone interested in implementing it. This 3D implementation extends our previous 2D algorithm by incorporating a failure probability of the syndrome measurements, i.e., it enables fault-tolerant decoding. We report a fault-tolerant storage threshold of $\\sim1.9(4)\\%$ for Kitaev's toric code subject to a 3D bit-flip channel (i.e. including imperfect syndrome measurements). This number is to be compared with the $2.9\\%$ value obtained via perfect matching \\cite{H04a}. The 3D generalization inherits many properties of the 2D algorithm, including a complexity linear in the space-time volume of the memory, which can be parallelized to logarithmic time.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.26421/qic14.9-10-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]],"date-time":"2021-03-01T04:01:06Z","timestamp":1614571266000},"page":"721-740","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":16,"title":"Fault-tolerant renormalization group decoder for abelian topological codes","prefix":"10.26421","volume":"14","author":[{"given":"Guillaume","family":"Duclos-Cianci","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"David","family":"Poulin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"10955","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]},"container-title":"Quantum Information and Computation","original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]],"date-time":"2021-03-01T04:01:07Z","timestamp":1614571267000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://www.rintonpress.com/journals/doi/QIC14.9-10-1.html"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"9&10","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.26421/QIC14.9-10-1","relation":{},"ISSN":["1533-7146","1533-7146"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","General Physics and Astronomy","Mathematical Physics","Nuclear and High Energy Physics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Theoretical Computer Science"],"container-title-short":"QIC","published":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]},"reference":[],"id":"doi:10.26421/QIC14.9-10-1","_hash":"869b6a4988e3923c2adb9316b17e283d0ba7d103fa7bc50c8d4042d706c8c4f0"},"expire":1698577363220},"doi:10.26421/QIC15.1-2-9":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]],"date-time":"2022-09-27T05:29:21Z","timestamp":1664256561830},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Rinton Press","issue":"1&2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>Consider a 2-D square array of qubits of extent $L\\times L$.

Other key topics covered include the definition of the power spectral density of nonstationary stochastic processes, the geometry of the space of energy-limited signals, the isometry properties of the Fourier transform, and complex sampling. Including over 500 homework problems and all the necessary mathematical background, this is the ideal text for one- or two-semester graduate courses on digital communications and courses on stochastic processes and detection theory. Solutions to problems and video lectures are available online.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/9781316822708","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]],"date-time":"2017-03-01T11:36:03Z","timestamp":1488368163000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":35,"title":"A Foundation in Digital Communication","prefix":"10.1017","author":[{"given":"Amos","family":"Lapidoth","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,2]]},"container-title":[],"original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,12]],"date-time":"2022-06-12T08:29:20Z","timestamp":1655022560000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781316822708/type/book"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,8]]},"ISBN":["9781107177321","9781316822708"],"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/9781316822708","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,8]]},"reference":[],"id":"doi:10.1017/9781316822708","_hash":"9ce5b238be273169f278a89e26bb88ddc94910fe30ca2c46223751121529dc07"},"expire":1699015605397},"doi:10.1109/TIT.1954.1057466":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,4]],"date-time":"2022-04-04T21:22:36Z","timestamp":1649107356996},"reference-count":5,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"4","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[1954,9,1]],"date-time":"1954-09-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":-483926400000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1954,9]]},"DOI":"10.1109/tit.1954.1057466","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,4,27]],"date-time":"2004-04-27T18:27:04Z","timestamp":1083090424000},"page":"50-63","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":43,"title":"Coding for constant-data-rate systems","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"4","author":[{"given":"R.","family":"Silverman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.","family":"Balser","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"263","reference":[],"container-title":"Transactions of the IRE Professional Group on Information Theory","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/4547596/22771/01057466.pdf?arnumber=1057466","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]],"date-time":"2022-01-12T16:55:01Z","timestamp":1642006501000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1057466/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1954,9]]},"references-count":5,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4"},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.1954.1057466","relation":{},"ISSN":["2168-2690","2168-2704"],"subject":["Library and Information Sciences","Computer Science Applications","Information Systems"],"container-title-short":"Trans.

This first course in the mathematical theory of modem design introduces the theory of digital modulation and coding that underpins the design of digital telecommunications systems. A detailed treatment of core subjects is provided, including baseband and passband modulation and demodulation, equalization, and sequence estimation. The modulation waveforms for communication channels and digital recording channels are treated in a common setting and with unified terminology. A variety of more advanced topics is also covered, such as trellis codes, turbo codes, the Viterbi algorithm, block codes, maximum likelihood and maximum posterior probability, iterative demodulation, and jamming. Numerous end-of-chapter exercises are also included to test the reader's understanding throughout. This insightful book is ideal for senior undergraduate students studying digital communications and is also a useful reference for practising engineers.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/cbo9780511811401","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,19]],"date-time":"2012-06-19T16:47:33Z","timestamp":1340124453000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Modem Theory","prefix":"10.1017","author":[{"given":"Richard E.","family":"Blahut","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,5]]},"container-title":[],"original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,11]],"date-time":"2022-06-11T02:23:16Z","timestamp":1654914196000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511811401/type/book"}},"subtitle":["An Introduction to Telecommunications"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,26]]},"ISBN":["9780521780148","9780511811401"],"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511811401","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2009,11,26]]},"reference":[],"id":"doi:10.1017/CBO9780511811401","_hash":"ea3e4c5442ecd694a85364d7998a455b612edeede9fa0ebe4a6391602c3ced3a"},"expire":1699015618315},"doi:10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb00917.x":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,8]],"date-time":"2022-11-08T07:49:57Z","timestamp":1667893797348},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"4","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1948,10]]},"DOI":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb00917.x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,29]],"date-time":"2013-07-29T15:27:00Z","timestamp":1375111620000},"page":"623-656","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7489,"title":"A Mathematical Theory of Communication","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"27","author":[{"given":"C.

Maximal designed distances of primitive Hermitian dual containing $q^{2}$-ary BCH codes (narrow-sense or non-narrow-sense) are determined by a careful analysis of properties of cyclotomic cosets. Non-narrow-sense BCH codes which achieve these maximal designed distances are presented, and a sequence of nested non-narrow-sense BCH codes that contain these BCH codes with maximal designed distances are constructed and their parameters are computed. Consequently, new nonbinary quantum BCH codes are derived from these non-narrow-sense BCH codes. The nonbinary quantum BCH codes presented here have better parameters than those quantum BCH codes available in the literature.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.26421/qic13.1-2-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,4]],"date-time":"2021-03-04T03:06:29Z","timestamp":1614827189000},"page":"21-35","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Hermitian dual containing BCH codes and Construction of new quantum codes","prefix":"10.26421","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"Ruihu","family":"Li","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Fei","family":"Zou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yang","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Zongben","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"10955","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"container-title":"Quantum Information and Computation","original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,4]],"date-time":"2021-03-04T03:06:44Z","timestamp":1614827204000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://www.rintonpress.com/journals/doi/QIC13.1-2-3.html"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1&2","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.26421/QIC13.1-2-3","relation":{},"ISSN":["1533-7146","1533-7146"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","General Physics and Astronomy","Mathematical Physics","Nuclear and High Energy Physics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Theoretical Computer Science"],"container-title-short":"QIC","published":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"reference":[],"id":"doi:10.26421/QIC13.1-2-3","_hash":"eb8f9231f4a67d44f3444f5e214aa1893113a26d2379dd3e38c53aea8f58ee3d"},"expire":1701130338907},"doi:10.1109/TIT.2006.890730":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T15:55:57Z","timestamp":1669996557059},"reference-count":22,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"3","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,1]],"date-time":"2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1172707200000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2007,3]]},"DOI":"10.1109/tit.2006.890730","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,2]],"date-time":"2007-03-02T22:45:22Z","timestamp":1172875522000},"page":"1183-1188","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":220,"title":"On Quantum and Classical BCH Codes","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"53","author":[{"given":"Salah A.","family":"Aly","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andreas","family":"Klappenecker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pradeep Kiran","family":"Sarvepalli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"263","reference":[],"container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/18/4106106/04106108.pdf?arnumber=4106108","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,23]],"date-time":"2021-12-23T00:59:02Z","timestamp":1640221142000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4106108/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3]]},"references-count":22,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3"},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.890730","relation":{},"ISSN":["0018-9448"],"subject":["Library and Information Sciences","Computer Science Applications","Information Systems"],"container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

Efficient quantum algorithms and protocols have been developed for performing some tasks (e.g., factoring large numbers, securely communicating over a public channel, and simulating quantum mechanical systems) that appear to be very difficult with just classical resources.  In addition to identifying the separation between classical and quantum computational power, much of the theoretical focus in this field over the last decade has been concerned with finding novel ways of encoding quantum information that are robust against errors, which is an important step toward building practical quantum information processing devices.\n\nIn this thesis I present some results on the quantum error-correcting properties of oscillator codes (also described as symplectic lattice codes) and toric codes.  Any harmonic oscillator system, such as a mode of light, can be encoded with quantum information via symplectic lattice codes that are robust against shifts in the system's continuous quantum variables.  I show the existence of lattice codes whose achievable rates match the one-shot coherent information over the Gaussian quantum channel.  Also, I construct a family of symplectic self-dual lattices and search for optimal encodings of quantum information distributed between several oscillators.\n\nToric codes provide encodings of quantum information into two-dimensional spin lattices that are robust against local clusters of errors and which require only local quantum operations for error correction.  Numerical simulations of this system under realistic error models provide a calculation of the accuracy threshold for quantum memory using toric codes, which can be related to phase transitions in particular condensed matter models.  I also present a local classical processing scheme for correcting errors on toric codes, which demonstrates that quantum information can be maintained in two dimensions by purely local quantum and classical resources.","DOI":"10.7907/AHMQ-EG82","publisher":"California Institute of Technology","title":"Analysis of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes: Symplectic Lattice Codes and Toric Codes","URL":"https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechETD:etd-05122004-113132","copyright":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","version":"Final","reference":[],"_hash":"347fe3088c237ff38c67e94a1ba231070cc7858231e4c4d55cf02eaf6558b350"},"expire":1701130346718},"doi:10.6028/jres.069B.013":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,25]],"date-time":"2022-11-25T05:36:14Z","timestamp":1669354574244},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)","issue":"1 and 2","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1965,1]]},"DOI":"10.6028/jres.069b.013","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,17]],"date-time":"2012-08-17T15:49:20Z","timestamp":1345218560000},"page":"125","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":969,"title":"Maximum matching and a polyhedron with 0,1-vertices","prefix":"10.6028","volume":"69B","author":[{"given":"Jack","family":"Edmonds","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"4068","container-title":"Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards Section B Mathematics and Mathematical Physics","original-title":[],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,6]],"date-time":"2018-03-06T09:23:28Z","timestamp":1520328208000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/69B/jresv69Bn1-2p125_A1b.pdf"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1965,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1 and 2","published-print":{"date-parts":[[1965,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/jres.069B.013","relation":{},"ISSN":["0022-4340"],"subject":["Community and Home Care"],"container-title-short":"J.

We explore the question of how one can achieve fault- tolerant quantum computation with topological codes. We treat quantum error-correcting codes not only as a compelling ingredient needed to build a quantum computer, but also as a useful theoretical tool in other areas of physics. In particular, we explore what insights topological codes can provide into challenging questions, such as the classification of quantum phases of matter.\n\nIn this thesis, we focus on a family of topological codes — color codes, which are particularly intriguing due to the rich physics they display and their computational power. We start by introducing color codes and explaining their basic properties. Then, we show how to perform fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with three-dimensional color codes by transverse gates and code switching. We later compare the resource overhead of the code-switching approach with that of a state distillation scheme. We discuss how to perform error correction with the toric and color codes, as well as introduce local decoders for those two families of codes. By exploiting a connection between error correction and statistical mechanics we estimate the storage threshold error rates for bit-flip and phase-flip noise in the three-dimensional color code. We finish by showing that the color and toric code families in d dimensions are equivalent in a sense of local unitary transformations and explore implications of this equivalence.","DOI":"10.7907/059V-MG69","publisher":"California Institute of Technology","title":"The ABCs of the Color Code: A Study of Topological Quantum Codes as Toy Models for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation and Quantum Phases Of Matter","URL":"https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05282018-173928314","copyright":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","version":"Final","reference":[],"_hash":"2b8fe7163dfb727bb3cf03d9c769010671607be7a2aa6a038ef7b6cd04ace1c1"},"expire":1701130356701},"doi:10.1088/1367-2630/13/4/043005":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,24]],"date-time":"2022-10-24T13:28:53Z","timestamp":1666618133823},"reference-count":29,"publisher":"IOP Publishing","issue":"4","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1088/1367-2630/13/4/043005","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,8]],"date-time":"2011-04-08T03:39:51Z","timestamp":1302233991000},"page":"043005","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":44,"title":"Clifford gates by code deformation","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"13","author":[{"given":"H","family":"Bombin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,7]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"New Journal of Physics","original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]],"date-time":"2020-04-11T15:15:00Z","timestamp":1586618100000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/13/4/043005"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,7]]},"references-count":29,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2011,4,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/13/4/043005","relation":{},"ISSN":["1367-2630"],"subject":["General Physics and Astronomy"],"container-title-short":"New J.

Its two-dimensional version, the triangular color code, may soon be realized with currently available superconducting hardware despite constrained qubit connectivity. To guide this experimental effort, we study the storage threshold of the triangular color code against circuit-level depolarizing noise. First, we adapt the Restriction Decoder to the setting of the triangular color code and to phenomenological noise. Then, we propose a fault-tolerant implementation of the stabilizer measurement circuits, which incorporates flag qubits. We show how information from flag qubits can be used in an efficient and scalable way with the Restriction Decoder to maintain the effective distance of the code. We numerically estimate the threshold of the triangular color code to be 0.2%, which is competitive with the thresholds of other topological quantum codes. We also prove that 1-flag stabilizer measurement circuits are sufficient to preserve the full code distance, which may be used to find simpler syndrome extraction circuits of the color code.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,8]],"date-time":"2020-01-08T22:16:52Z","timestamp":1578521812000},"page":"023019","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":34,"title":"Triangular color codes on trivalent graphs with flag qubits","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"22","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3239-5783","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Christopher","family":"Chamberland","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Aleksander","family":"Kubica","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Theodore J","family":"Yoder","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guanyu","family":"Zhu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,7]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"New Journal of Physics","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,24]],"date-time":"2021-11-24T21:51:16Z","timestamp":1637790676000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"references-count":59,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,7]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab68fd","relation":{},"ISSN":["1367-2630"],"subject":["General Physics and Astronomy"],"container-title-short":"New J.

However, the two-qubit error-correction technique, known as ‘flagged’ syndrome extraction, works slowly, measuring only one syndrome at a time. This is a disadvantage in experiments with high qubit rest error rates. We extend the technique to extract multiple syndromes at once, without needing more qubits. Qubits for different syndromes can flag errors in each other. This gives equally fast and more qubit-efficient alternatives to Steane’s error-correction method, and also conforms to planar geometry constraints. We further show that Steane’s code and some others can be error-corrected with no extra qubits, provided there are at least two code blocks. The rough idea is that two seven-qubit codewords can be temporarily joined into a twelve-qubit code, freeing two qubits for flagged syndrome measurement.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,4]],"date-time":"2020-12-04T13:40:28Z","timestamp":1607089228000},"page":"015007","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":"Fault-tolerant quantum error correction for Steane’s seven-qubit color code with few or no extra qubits","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"6","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4934-8732","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ben W","family":"Reichardt","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum Science and Technology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,23]],"date-time":"2022-01-23T02:12:06Z","timestamp":1642903926000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]]},"references-count":20,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/abc6f4","relation":{},"ISSN":["2058-9565"],"subject":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum Sci.

Completely zero-field operation is desirable for scaling up a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Here we demonstrate quantum error correction to protect the nuclear spin of the nitrogen as a quantum memory in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center with two nuclear spins of the surrounding carbon isotopes under a zero magnetic field. The quantum error correction makes quantum memory resilient against operational or environmental errors without the need for magnetic fields and opens a way toward distributed quantum computation and

This 10th anniversary edition includes an introduction from the authors setting the work in context. This comprehensive textbook describes such remarkable effects as fast quantum algorithms, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography and quantum error-correction. Quantum mechanics and computer science are introduced before moving on to describe what a quantum computer is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than 'classical' computers and its real-world implementation. It concludes with an in-depth treatment of quantum information. Containing a wealth of figures and exercises, this well-known textbook is ideal for courses on the subject, and will interest beginning graduate students and researchers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and electrical engineering.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/cbo9780511976667","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,18]],"date-time":"2012-06-18T17:58:14Z","timestamp":1340042294000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3215,"title":"Quantum

Many schemes for fault-tolerant quantum information processing have been developed so far, one of which, called topological quantum computation, makes use of degrees of freedom that are inherently insensitive to local errors. However, this scheme is not so reliable against thermal errors. Other fault-tolerant schemes achieve better reliability through active error correction, but incur a substantial overhead cost. Thus, it is of practical importance and theoretical interest to design and assess fault-tolerant schemes that work well at finite temperature without active error correction.\n\nIn this thesis, a three-dimensional gapped lattice spin model is found which demonstrates for the first time that a reliable quantum memory at finite temperature is possible, at least to some extent. When quantum information is encoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to thermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without any active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors well localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved faithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the inverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological quantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales exponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.\n\nThis spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order, in which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are immobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to perturbations, is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size, and the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself under real-space renormalization group transformations. The degeneracy, the excitations, and the renormalization group flow can be analyzed using a framework that exploits the spin model's symmetry and some associated free resolutions of modules over polynomial algebras.","DOI":"10.7907/GCYW-ZE58","publisher":"California Institute of Technology","title":"Lattice Quantum Codes and Exotic Topological Phases of

This highly successful textbook, widely regarded as the 'bible of computer algebra', gives a thorough introduction to the algorithmic basis of the mathematical engine in computer algebra systems. Designed to accompany one- or two-semester courses for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in computer science or mathematics, its comprehensiveness and reliability has also made it an essential reference for professionals in the area. Special features include: detailed study of algorithms including time analysis; implementation reports on several topics; complete proofs of the mathematical underpinnings; and a wide variety of applications (among others, in chemistry, coding theory, cryptography, computational logic, and the design of calendars and musical scales). A great deal of historical information and illustration enlivens the text. In this third edition, errors have been corrected and much of the Fast Euclidean Algorithm chapter has been renovated.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/cbo9781139856065","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,5]],"date-time":"2013-05-05T04:17:34Z","timestamp":1367727454000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":194,"title":"Modern

We consider the SNF of a matrix A to be the ratio of two ℤ-modules -- a finitely generated abelian group; this is called the Smith group of A. The Smith group provides a unified setting to present both new and old results. The new results concern the relationship between the eigenvalues of an integral matrix and its SNF. In particular, the multiplicities of integer eigenvalues are shown to relate to the multiplicities in the type of the Smith group. Bounds are also given for the exponent of the Smith group. In some cases, these are best possible. The old results discussed are the interlacing of the SNF in the case of augmented matrices and the symmetries of the SNF for certain combinatorial matrices. The latter results are extended to rectangular matrices. Numerous examples are given throughout, along with many conjectures based on computation.\n\nThe second chapter generalizes the work of Pless, et al. on duadic codes and Q-codes. We take abelian group codes to be ideals in the group ring F[G], where G is a finite abelian group of odd order n and F is a finite field with characteristic relatively prime to n. We define generalized Q-codes from a pair of idempotents of F[G] and an automorphism of G which together obey two simple equations. These codes are (n, (n+1)/2) and (n, (n-1)/2) linear codes. We show that all of the properties of duadic and Q-codes generalize. In particular, we extend the results on the relationship of these codes to projective planes with regular automorphism group G. When F has characteristic 2, we give simple numerical conditions on G and F which determine when generalized Q-codes exist. We also give some techniques for constructing these codes.","DOI":"10.7907/CZA5-PX53","publisher":"California Institute of Technology","title":"Topics in Integral Matrices and Abelian Group

The topics which have been selected, including spin glasses, error correcting codes, satisfiability, are central to each field. The approach focuses on the limit of large random instances, adopting a common formulation in terms of graphical models. It presents message passing algorithms like belief propagation and survey propagation, and their use in decoding and constraint satisfaction solving. It also explains analysis techniques like density evolution and the cavity method, and uses them to derive phase diagrams and study phase transitions.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198570837.001.0001","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,11]],"date-time":"2009-09-11T01:59:10Z","timestamp":1252634350000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":918,"title":"Information,

The celebrated equivalence of this theorem and inapproximability of certain optimization problems, due to Feige et al. [1996], has placed the PCP theorem at the heart of the area of inapproximability.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In this work, we present a new proof of the PCP theorem that draws on this equivalence. We give a combinatorial proof for the NP-hardness of approximating a certain constraint satisfaction problem, which can then be reinterpreted to yield the PCP theorem.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            Our approach is to consider the\n            <jats:italic>unsat value</jats:italic>\n            of a constraint system, which is the smallest fraction of unsatisfied constraints, ranging over all possible assignments for the underlying variables. We describe a new combinatorial amplification transformation that doubles the unsat-value of a constraint-system, with only a linear blowup in the size of the system. The amplification step causes an increase in alphabet-size that is corrected by a (standard) PCP composition step. Iterative application of these two steps yields a proof for the PCP theorem.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The amplification lemma relies on a new notion of “graph powering” that can be applied to systems of binary constraints. This powering amplifies the unsat-value of a constraint system provided that the underlying graph structure is an expander.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            We also extend our amplification lemma towards construction of assignment testers (alternatively, PCPs of Proximity) which are slightly stronger objects than PCPs.

It includes in-depth coverage of the mathematics of reliable information transmission, both in two-terminal and multi-terminal network scenarios. Updated and considerably expanded, this new edition presents unique discussions of information theoretic secrecy and of zero-error information theory, including the deep connections of the latter with extremal combinatorics. The presentations of all core subjects are self contained, even the advanced topics, which helps readers to understand the important connections between seemingly different problems. Finally, 320 end-of-chapter problems, together with helpful solving hints, allow readers to develop a full command of the mathematical techniques. It is an ideal resource for graduate students and researchers in electrical and electronic engineering, computer science and applied mathematics.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017/cbo9780511921889","type":"monograph","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,8]],"date-time":"2012-08-08T15:37:41Z","timestamp":1344440261000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":885,"title":"Information Theory","prefix":"10.1017","author":[{"given":"Imre","family":"Csiszár","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"János","family":"Körner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,5]]},"container-title":[],"original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,12]],"date-time":"2022-10-12T17:17:02Z","timestamp":1665595022000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511921889/type/book"}},"subtitle":["Coding Theorems for Discrete Memoryless Systems"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,30]]},"ISBN":["9780511921889","9780521196819","9781107565043"],"references-count":0,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511921889","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,30]]},"reference":[],"id":"doi:10.1017/CBO9780511921889","_hash":"1a830878a1ead62c0481a16c330d5aee9ff1c40f7bbb95899ab94a71a1478cd9"},"expire":1701130665872},"doi:10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5707068":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,4]],"date-time":"2022-08-04T16:28:31Z","timestamp":1659630511529},"reference-count":10,"publisher":"IEEE","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"DOI":"10.1109/allerton.2010.5707068","type":"proceedings-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,3]],"date-time":"2011-02-03T21:50:52Z","timestamp":1296769852000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":46,"title":"Channel dispersion and moderate deviations limits for memoryless channels","prefix":"10.1109","author":[{"given":"Yury","family":"Polyanskiy","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sergio","family":"Verdu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"263","reference":[],"event":"2010 48th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","container-title":"2010 48th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/5701578/5706874/05707068.pdf?arnumber=5707068","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,21]],"date-time":"2017-03-21T04:16:57Z","timestamp":1490069817000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5707068/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"references-count":10,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5707068","relation":{},"published":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"id":"doi:10.1109/ALLERTON.2010.5707068","_hash":"531a9c1837317f491911b2e065612752ae8312e57df3cb5792136cd26b4e0c4c"},"expire":1701130666872},"doi:10.1109/TIT.2010.2043769":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T16:10:00Z","timestamp":1669997400967},"reference-count":51,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"5","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2010,5,1]],"date-time":"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1272672000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2010,5]]},"DOI":"10.1109/tit.2010.2043769","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,26]],"date-time":"2010-04-26T17:35:55Z","timestamp":1272303355000},"page":"2307-2359","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1805,"title":"Channel Coding Rate in the Finite Blocklength Regime","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"56","author":[{"given":"Yury","family":"Polyanskiy","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"H.

Moreover, no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery, even in the face of high loss rates.We develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using a new class of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes.

This summary of the state-of-the-art in iterative coding makes this decision more straightforward. With emphasis on the underlying theory, techniques to analyse and design practical iterative coding systems are presented. Using Gallager's original ensemble of LDPC codes, the basic concepts are extended for several general codes, including the practically important class of turbo codes. The simplicity of the binary erasure channel is exploited to develop analytical techniques and intuition, which are then applied to general channel models. A chapter on factor graphs helps to unify the important topics of information theory, coding and communication theory. Covering the most recent advances, this text is ideal for graduate students in electrical engineering and computer science, and practitioners.

Specifically, these are codes accompanied with tests that make a constant number of (random) queries into any given word and reject non-codewords with probability proportional to their distance from the code.Locally testable codes are believed to be the combinatorial core of PCPs. However, the relation is less immediate than commonly believed. Nevertheless, we show that certain PCP systems can be modified to yield locally testable codes. On the other hand, we adapt techniques that we develop for the construction of the latter to yield new PCPs.Our main results are locally testable codes and PCPs of almost-linear length. Specifically, we prove the existence of the following constructs:---Locally testable binary (linear) codes in which\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            information bits are encoded by a codeword of length\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            ⋅ exp(Õ(√(log\n            <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>\n            ))). This improves over previous results that either yield codewords of exponential length or obtained almost quadratic length codewords for sufficiently large nonbinary alphabet.---PCP systems of almost-linear length for SAT. The length of the proof is\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            ⋅ exp(Õ(√(log\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            ))) and verification in performed by a constant number (i.e., 19) of queries, as opposed to previous results that used proof length\n            <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>\n              (1 +\n              <jats:italic>O</jats:italic>\n              (1/\n              <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>\n              ))\n            </jats:sup>\n            for verification by\n            <jats:italic>q</jats:italic>\n            queries.The novel techniques in use include a random projection of certain codewords and PCP-oracles that preserves local-testability, an adaptation of PCP constructions to obtain “linear PCP-oracles” for proving conjunctions of linear conditions, and design of PCPs with some new soundness properties---a direct construction of locally testable (linear) codes of subexponential length.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145/1162349.1162351","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,18]],"date-time":"2006-10-18T18:11:32Z","timestamp":1161195092000},"page":"558-655","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":78,"title":"Locally testable codes and PCPs of almost-linear length","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"53","author":[{"given":"Oded","family":"Goldreich","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"}]},{"given":"Madhu","family":"Sudan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[],"container-title":"Journal of the ACM","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1162349.1162351","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,20]],"date-time":"2021-02-20T06:46:19Z","timestamp":1613803579000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1162349.1162351"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,7]]},"references-count":32,"journal-issue":{"issue":"4","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2006,7]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1145/1162349.1162351"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1162349.1162351","relation":{},"ISSN":["0004-5411","1557-735X"],"subject":["Artificial Intelligence","Hardware and Architecture","Information Systems","Control and Systems Engineering","Software"],"container-title-short":"J.

Only degenerate codes with the maximal stabilizer weight much smaller than their minimum distance are considered. It is shown that with the help of OSD-like post-processing the performance of the standard belief propagation (BP) decoder on many QLDPC codes can be improved by several orders of magnitude. Using this new BP-OSD decoder we study the performance of several known classes of degenerate QLDPC codes including hypergraph product codes, hyperbicycle codes, homological product codes, and Haah's cubic codes. We also construct several interesting examples of short generalized bicycle codes. Some of them have an additional property that their syndromes are protected by small BCH codes, which may be useful for the fault-tolerant syndrome measurement. We also propose a new large family of QLDPC codes that contains the class of hypergraph product codes, where one of the used parity-check matrices is square. It is shown that in some cases such codes have better performance than hypergraph product codes. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance of the proposed BP-OSD decoder for some of the constructed codes is better than for a relatively large surface code decoded by a near-optimal decoder.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2021-11-22-585","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]],"date-time":"2021-11-22T14:01:32Z","timestamp":1637589692000},"page":"585","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":13,"title":"Degenerate Quantum LDPC Codes With Good Finite Length Performance","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"5","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6772-7867","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pavel","family":"Panteleev","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, Moscow State University, GSP-1, Leninskie Gory, Moscow, 119991, Russian Federation"}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2695-3179","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gleb","family":"Kalachev","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, Moscow State University, GSP-1, Leninskie Gory, Moscow, 119991, Russian Federation"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-11-22-585/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]],"date-time":"2021-11-22T14:01:42Z","timestamp":1637589702000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-11-22-585/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"references-count":45,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-11-22-585","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,22]]},"article-number":"585","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2021-11-22-585","_hash":"9b1e2e1b89348c1e24cdd1b0a2c0da98be626d87ef53e3411ac92eb66290ef14"},"expire":1701130803244},"doi:10.1109/TIT.2021.3097347":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,1]],"date-time":"2022-12-01T13:16:05Z","timestamp":1669900565596},"reference-count":43,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"10","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]],"date-time":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1633046400000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]],"date-time":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1633046400000},"content-version":"stm-asf","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]],"date-time":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1633046400000},"content-version":"stm-asf","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-037"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/501100000765","name":"University College London Quantum Science and Technology Institute (UCLQ) Fellowship","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100000266","name":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Prosperity Partnership in Quantum Software for Simulation and Modelling","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["EP/S005021/1"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"DOI":"10.1109/tit.2021.3097347","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,10]],"date-time":"2021-08-10T23:44:32Z","timestamp":1628639072000},"page":"6653-6674","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":13,"title":"Balanced Product Quantum Codes","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"67","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7211-5515","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nikolas P.","family":"Breuckmann","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jens N.","family":"Eberhardt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"263","reference":[],"container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/18/9539105/09490244.pdf?arnumber=9490244","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]],"date-time":"2022-05-10T14:54:30Z","timestamp":1652194470000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9490244/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"references-count":43,"journal-issue":{"issue":"10"},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3097347","relation":{},"ISSN":["0018-9448","1557-9654"],"subject":["Library and Information Sciences","Computer Science Applications","Information Systems"],"container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

The resulting generalised stabiliser formalism – denoted the XP stabiliser formalism – allows for a wider range of states and codespaces to be represented. We describe the states which arise in the formalism, and demonstrate an equivalence between XP stabiliser states and 'weighted hypergraph states' – a generalisation of both hypergraph and weighted graph states. Given an arbitrary set of XP operators, we present algorithms for determining the codespace and logical operators for an XP code. Finally, we consider whether measurements of XP operators on XP codes can be classically simulated.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-09-22-815","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,22]],"date-time":"2022-09-22T15:25:34Z","timestamp":1663860334000},"page":"815","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"The

The hexagonal form of these codes are particularly well-suited to the heavy-hexagon device layouts currently pursued in the hardware of IBM quantum. Here we show how the stabilizers of the code can be measured solely through two-body measurements that are native to the architecture. Though the subsystem code formed by these measurements has a trivial code space, the sequence in which they are measured allows the desired logical subspace to be preserved. This therefore achieves a result similar to the recently introduced Floquet codes, but via a completely different method. The process is then run on 27 and 65 qubit devices, to compare results with simulations for a standard error model. It is found that the results correspond well to simulations where the noise strength is similar to that found in the benchmarking of the devices. The best devices show results consistent with a noise model with an error probability of around 1.5%–2%.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,20]],"date-time":"2022-06-20T22:24:54Z","timestamp":1655763894000},"page":"295302","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"Hexagonal matching codes with two-body measurements","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"55","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1943-5306","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"James R","family":"Wootton","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,4]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,30]],"date-time":"2022-06-30T16:59:58Z","timestamp":1656608398000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,4]]},"references-count":24,"journal-issue":{"issue":"29","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,4]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,22]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ac7a75","relation":{},"ISSN":["1751-8113","1751-8121"],"subject":["General Physics and Astronomy","Mathematical Physics","Modeling and Simulation","Statistics and Probability","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics"],"container-title-short":"J.

Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for <jats:sup>171</jats:sup>Yb neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-32094-6","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,9]],"date-time":"2022-08-09T10:03:15Z","timestamp":1660039395000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Erasure

The challenge is to design practical quantum error-correcting codes that perform well against realistic noise using modest resources. Here we show that a variant of the surface code—the XZZX code—offers remarkable performance for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The error threshold of this code matches what can be achieved with random codes (hashing) for every single-qubit Pauli noise channel; it is the first explicit code shown to have this universal property. We present numerical evidence that the threshold even exceeds this hashing bound for an experimentally relevant range of noise parameters. Focusing on the common situation where qubit dephasing is the dominant noise, we show that this code has a practical, high-performance decoder and surpasses all previously known thresholds in the realistic setting where syndrome measurements are unreliable. We go on to demonstrate the favourable sub-threshold resource scaling that can be obtained by specialising a code to exploit structure in the noise. We show that it is possible to maintain all of these advantages when we perform fault-tolerant quantum computation.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-22274-1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]],"date-time":"2021-04-12T10:09:07Z","timestamp":1618222147000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":34,"title":"The XZZX surface code","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"12","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5518-7907","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"J.

We develop a leakage-detection scheme via Hidden Markov models (HMMs) for transmon-based implementations of the surface code. By performing realistic density-matrix simulations of the distance-3 surface code (Surface-17), we observe that leakage is sharply projected and leads to an increase in the surface-code defect probability of neighboring stabilizers. Together with the analog readout of the ancilla qubits, this increase enables the accurate detection of the time and location of leakage. We restore the logical error rate below the memory break-even point by post-selecting out leakage, discarding less than half of the data for the given noise parameters. Leakage detection via HMMs opens the prospect for near-term QEC demonstrations, targeted leakage reduction and leakage-aware decoding and is applicable to other experimental platforms.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-020-00330-w","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,14]],"date-time":"2020-12-14T11:13:36Z","timestamp":1607944416000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":15,"title":"Leakage detection for a transmon-based surface code","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"6","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7124-8933","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Boris Mihailov","family":"Varbanov","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4800-2518","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Francesco","family":"Battistel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Brian Michael","family":"Tarasinski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9892-3759","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Viacheslav Petrovych","family":"Ostroukh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Thomas Eugene","family":"O’Brien","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Leonardo","family":"DiCarlo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0218-6614","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Barbara Maria","family":"Terhal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,14]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"npj Quantum Information","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00330-w.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00330-w","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00330-w.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]],"date-time":"2021-12-02T16:52:59Z","timestamp":1638463979000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00330-w"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"references-count":55,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]}},"alternative-id":["330"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41534-020-00330-w","relation":{},"ISSN":["2056-6387"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","Computer Networks and Communications","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Computer Science (miscellaneous)"],"container-title-short":"npj Quantum Inf","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"assertion":[{"value":"6 March 2020","order":1,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"2 October 2020","order":2,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"14 December 2020","order":3,"name":"first_online","label":"First Online","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"The authors declare no competing interests.","order":1,"name":"Ethics","group":{"name":"EthicsHeading","label":"Competing interests"}}],"article-number":"102","id":"doi:10.1038/s41534-020-00330-w","_hash":"40192785a1c8ba60d1a57ef903462648dd3374155d4d987c4da0cd6aa8580913"},"expire":1701130843579},"doi:10.1038/s41534-017-0039-x":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T11:52:40Z","timestamp":1669981960917},"reference-count":38,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"1","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,25]],"date-time":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1506297600000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["link.springer.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"DOI":"10.1038/s41534-017-0039-x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,18]],"date-time":"2017-09-18T14:28:20Z","timestamp":1505744900000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":48,"title":"Density-matrix simulation of small surface codes under current and projected experimental noise","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"T.

ability to engineer parallel, programmable operations between desired qubits within a quantum processor is key for building scalable quantum information systems<jats:sup>1,2</jats:sup>. In most state-of-the-art approaches, qubits interact locally, constrained by the connectivity associated with their fixed spatial layout. Here we demonstrate a quantum processor with dynamic, non-local connectivity, in which entangled qubits are coherently transported in a highly parallel manner across two spatial dimensions, between layers of single- and two-qubit operations. Our approach makes use of neutral atom arrays trapped and transported by optical tweezers; hyperfine states are used for robust quantum information storage, and excitation into Rydberg states is used for entanglement generation<jats:sup>3–5</jats:sup>. We use this architecture to realize programmable generation of entangled graph states, such as cluster states and a seven-qubit Steane code state<jats:sup>6,7</jats:sup>. Furthermore, we shuttle entangled ancilla arrays to realize a surface code state with thirteen data and six ancillary qubits<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> and a toric code state on a torus with sixteen data and eight ancillary qubits<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>. Finally, we use this architecture to realize a hybrid analogue–digital evolution<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and use it for measuring entanglement entropy in quantum simulations<jats:sup>10–12</jats:sup>, experimentally observing non-monotonic entanglement dynamics associated with quantum many-body scars<jats:sup>13,14</jats:sup>. Realizing a long-standing goal, these results provide a route towards scalable quantum processing and enable applications ranging from simulation to metrology.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04592-6","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,20]],"date-time":"2022-04-20T16:03:41Z","timestamp":1650470621000},"page":"451-456","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":35,"title":"A quantum processor based on coherent transport of entangled atom arrays","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"604","author":[{"given":"Dolev","family":"Bluvstein","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Harry","family":"Levine","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Giulia","family":"Semeghini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tout T.","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sepehr","family":"Ebadi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0605-8791","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marcin","family":"Kalinowski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alexander","family":"Keesling","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nishad","family":"Maskara","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hannes","family":"Pichler","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Markus","family":"Greiner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9786-0538","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vladan","family":"Vuletić","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8658-1007","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mikhail D.","family":"Lukin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,20]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Nature","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04592-6.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04592-6","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04592-6.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]],"date-time":"2022-04-21T13:21:12Z","timestamp":1650547272000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04592-6"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,20]]},"references-count":75,"journal-issue":{"issue":"7906","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,21]]}},"alternative-id":["4592"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04592-6","relation":{},"ISSN":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"subject":["Multidisciplinary"],"container-title-short":"Nature","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,20]]},"assertion":[{"value":"6 December 2021","order":1,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"28 February 2022","order":2,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"20 April 2022","order":3,"name":"first_online","label":"First Online","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"M.G., V.V. and M.D.L. are co-founders and shareholders of QuEra Computing.

As such, obtaining fast and flexible decoding algorithms for these codes, within the experimentally realistic and challenging context of faulty syndrome measurements, without requiring any final read-out of the physical qubits, is of critical importance. In this work, we show that the problem of decoding such codes can be naturally reformulated as a process of repeated interactions between a decoding agent and a code environment, to which the machinery of reinforcement learning can be applied to obtain decoding agents. While in principle this framework can be instantiated with environments modelling circuit level noise, we take a first step towards this goal by using deepQ learning to obtain decoding agents for a variety of simplified phenomenological noise models, which yield faulty syndrome measurements without including the propagation of errors which arise in full circuit level noise models.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1088/2632-2153/abc609","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]],"date-time":"2020-10-29T22:31:26Z","timestamp":1604010686000},"page":"025005","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":"Reinforcement learning decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computation","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"2","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6202-8864","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ryan","family":"Sweke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Markus S","family":"Kesselring","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0323-0031","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Evert P L","family":"van Nieuwenburg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jens","family":"Eisert","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,28]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Machine Learning: Science and Technology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,21]],"date-time":"2022-01-21T00:56:07Z","timestamp":1642726567000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,28]]},"references-count":69,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,28]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/abc609","relation":{},"ISSN":["2632-2153"],"subject":["Artificial Intelligence","Human-Computer Interaction","Software"],"container-title-short":"Mach.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate that this is not true. By writing distillation circuits in a form that separates qubits that are capable of error detection from those that are not, most logical qubits used for distillation can be encoded at a very low code distance. This significantly reduces the space-time cost of distillation, as well as the number of qubits. In extreme cases, it can cost less to distill a magic state than to perform a logical Clifford gate on full-distance logical qubits.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2019-12-02-205","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]],"date-time":"2019-12-02T13:45:29Z","timestamp":1575294329000},"page":"205","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":45,"title":"Magic State Distillation: Not as Costly as You Think","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"Daniel","family":"Litinski","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Dahlem Center for Complex Quantum Systems, Freie Universität Berlin, Arnimallee 14, 14195 Berlin, Germany"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2019-12-02-205/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,9]],"date-time":"2021-02-09T21:59:50Z","timestamp":1612907990000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2019-12-02-205/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]]},"references-count":42,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-12-02-205","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]]},"article-number":"205","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2019-12-02-205","_hash":"5f712373a22776b997cc9f4d0d114c8ef81efcaef09115742e52095339f2ae97"},"expire":1701130880646},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021029":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,12]],"date-time":"2022-10-12T02:19:53Z","timestamp":1665541193173},"reference-count":79,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"2","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]],"date-time":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1495584000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/100008398","name":"Villum Fonden","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100002339","name":"National Center of Competence in Research Affective Sciences - Emotions in Individual Behaviour and Social Processes","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100001659","name":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","doi-asserted-by":"publisher"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1103/physrevx.7.021029","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,25]],"date-time":"2017-05-25T02:08:33Z","timestamp":1495678113000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":59,"title":"Poking Holes and Cutting Corners to Achieve Clifford Gates with the Surface Code","prefix":"10.1103","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"Benjamin J.","family":"Brown","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Katharina","family":"Laubscher","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Markus S.","family":"Kesselring","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"James R.","family":"Wootton","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"16","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Physical Review X","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021029","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://harvest.aps.org/v2/journals/articles/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021029/fulltext","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,28]],"date-time":"2022-07-28T21:25:00Z","timestamp":1659043500000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021029"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,24]]},"references-count":79,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021029","relation":{},"ISSN":["2160-3308"],"subject":["General Physics and Astronomy"],"container-title-short":"Phys.

In this paper, we discuss strategies for surface-code quantum computing on small, intermediate and large scales. They are strategies for space-time trade-offs, going from slow computations using few qubits to fast computations using many qubits. Our schemes are based on surface-code patches, which not only feature a low space cost compared to other surface-code schemes, but are also conceptually simple~--~simple enough that they can be described as a tile-based game with a small set of rules. Therefore, no knowledge of quantum error correction is necessary to understand the schemes in this paper, but only the concepts of qubits and measurements.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2019-03-05-128","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]],"date-time":"2019-03-05T19:50:11Z","timestamp":1551815411000},"page":"128","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":74,"title":"A Game of Surface Codes: Large-Scale Quantum Computing with Lattice Surgery","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"Daniel","family":"Litinski","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Dahlem Center for Complex Quantum Systems, Freie Universität Berlin, Arnimallee 14, 14195 Berlin, Germany"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2019-03-05-128/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,13]],"date-time":"2022-09-13T01:04:56Z","timestamp":1663031096000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2019-03-05-128/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"references-count":65,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-03-05-128","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"article-number":"128","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2019-03-05-128","_hash":"5e55313238354f5042f90e2dbd845d171701f1bc5a0e1389b7cd57727c3153e5"},"expire":1701130886588},"doi:10.22331/q-2018-05-04-62":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T12:17:21Z","timestamp":1669983441435},"reference-count":27,"publisher":"Verein zur Forderung des Open Access Publizierens in den Quantenwissenschaften","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]],"date-time":"2018-05-04T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1525392000000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"abstract":"<jats:p>We present a planar surface-code-based scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation which eliminates the time overhead of single-qubit Clifford gates, and implements long-range multi-target CNOT gates with a time overhead that scales only logarithmically with the control-target separation.

Coherent errors (for example, unitary noise) can interfere constructively, so that in some cases the average infidelity of a quantum circuit subjected to coherent errors may increase quadratically with the circuit size; in contrast, when errors are incoherent (for example, depolarizing noise), the average infidelity increases at worst linearly with circuit size. We consider the performance of quantum stabilizer codes against a noise model in which a unitary rotation is applied to each qubit, where the axes and angles of rotation are nearly the same for all qubits. In particular, we show that for the toric code subject to such independent coherent noise, and for minimal-weight decoding, the logical channel after error correction becomes increasingly incoherent as the length of the code increases, provided the noise strength decays inversely with the code distance. A similar conclusion holds for weakly correlated coherent noise. Our methods can also be used for analyzing the performance of other codes and fault-tolerant protocols against coherent noise. However, our result does not show that the coherence of the logical channel is suppressed in the more physically relevant case where the noise strength is held constant as the code block grows, and we recount the difficulties that prevented us from extending the result to that case. Nevertheless our work supports the idea that fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes will work effectively against coherent noise, providing encouraging news for quantum hardware builders who worry about the damaging effects of control errors and coherent interactions with the environment.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,29]],"date-time":"2020-04-29T22:24:15Z","timestamp":1588199055000},"page":"073066","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":13,"title":"Coherence in logical quantum channels","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"22","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4665-8839","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joseph K","family":"Iverson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2421-4762","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John","family":"Preskill","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,31]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"New Journal of Physics","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,27]],"date-time":"2021-11-27T16:44:20Z","timestamp":1638031460000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"references-count":37,"journal-issue":{"issue":"7","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,31]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ab8e5c","relation":{},"ISSN":["1367-2630"],"subject":["General Physics and Astronomy"],"container-title-short":"New J.

Fractons are found in a variety of physical settings, such as spin liquids and elasticity theory, and exhibit unusual phenomenology, such as gravitational physics and localization. The past several years have seen a surge of interest in these exotic particles, which have come to the forefront of modern condensed matter theory. In this review, we provide a broad treatment of fractons, ranging from pedagogical introductory material to discussions of recent advances in the field. We begin by demonstrating how the fracton phenomenon naturally arises as a consequence of higher moment conservation laws, often accompanied by the emergence of tensor gauge theories. We then provide a survey of fracton phases in spin models, along with the various tools used to characterize them, such as the foliation framework. We discuss in detail the manifestation of fracton physics in elasticity theory, as well as the connections of fractons with localization and gravitation. Finally, we provide an overview of some recently proposed platforms for fracton physics, such as Majorana islands and hole-doped antiferromagnets. We conclude with some open questions and an outlook on the field. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1142/s0217751x20300033","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,18]],"date-time":"2020-03-18T13:12:51Z","timestamp":1584537171000},"page":"2030003","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":124,"title":"Fracton phases of matter","prefix":"10.1142","volume":"35","author":[{"given":"Michael","family":"Pretko","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics and Center for Theory of Quantum Matter, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309, USA"}]},{"given":"Xie","family":"Chen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics and Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA"}]},{"given":"Yizhi","family":"You","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, Princeton University, NJ 08544, USA"}]}],"member":"219","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,18]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"International Journal of Modern Physics A","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0217751X20300033","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]],"date-time":"2020-03-26T07:49:17Z","timestamp":1585208957000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X20300033"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,29]]},"references-count":97,"journal-issue":{"issue":"06","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,29]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1142/S0217751X20300033"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X20300033","relation":{},"ISSN":["0217-751X","1793-656X"],"subject":["Astronomy and Astrophysics","Nuclear and High Energy Physics","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Int.

Compared to independent depolarizing noise, leaked qubits may produce many more configurations of harmful correlated errors during error-correction. In this work, we investigate different local codes in the low-error regime of a leakage gate error model. When restricting to bare-ancilla extraction, we observe that subsystem codes are good candidates for handling leakage, as their locality can limit damaging correlated errors. As a case study, we compare subspace surface codes to the subsystem surface codes introduced by Bravyi <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>. In contrast to depolarizing noise, subsystem surface codes outperform same-distance subspace surface codes below error rates as high as ⪅ 7.5 × 10<jats:sup>−4</jats:sup> while offering better per-qubit distance protection. Furthermore, we show that at low to intermediate distances, Bacon–Shor codes offer better per-qubit error protection against leakage in an ion-trap motivated error model below error rates as high as ⪅ 1.2 × 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>. For restricted leakage models, this advantage can be extended to higher distances by relaxing to unverified two-qubit cat state extraction in the surface code.

It boasts the smallest known syndrome extraction circuits and correspondingly largest thresholds. Defect-based logical encodings of a new variety called twists have made it possible to implement the full Clifford group without state distillation. Here we investigate a patch-based encoding involving a modified twist. In our modified formulation, the resulting codes, called triangle codes for the shape of their planar layout, have only weight-four checks and relatively simple syndrome extraction circuits that maintain a high, near surface-code-level threshold. They also use 25% fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than the surface code. Moreover, benefiting from the twist, we can implement all Clifford gates by lattice surgery without the need for state distillation. By a surgical transformation to the surface code, we also develop a scheme of doing all Clifford gates on surface code patches in an atypical planar layout, though with less qubit efficiency than the triangle code. Finally, we remark that logical qubits encoded in triangle codes are naturally amenable to logical tomography, and the smallest triangle code can demonstrate high-pseudothreshold fault-tolerance to depolarizing noise using just 13 physical qubits.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2017-04-25-2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,25]],"date-time":"2017-04-25T08:44:49Z","timestamp":1493109889000},"page":"2","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":57,"title":"The surface code with a twist","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"1","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9614-2836","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Theodore J.","family":"Yoder","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}]},{"given":"Isaac H.","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"IBM, Thomas J.

Despite tremendous experimental efforts in the study of quantum error correction, to date, there has been no demonstration in the realisation of universal quantum error-correcting code, with the subsequent verification of all key features including the identification of an arbitrary physical error, the capability for transversal manipulation of the logical state and state decoding. To address this challenge, we experimentally realise the [5, 1, 3] code, the so-called smallest perfect code that permits corrections of generic single-qubit errors. In the experiment, having optimised the encoding circuit, we employ an array of superconducting qubits to realise the [5, 1, 3] code for several typical logical states including the magic state, an indispensable resource for realising non-Clifford gates. The encoded states are prepared with an average fidelity of $57.1(3)\\%$ while with a high fidelity of $98.6(1)\\%$ in the code space. Then, the arbitrary single-qubit errors introduced manually are identified by measuring the stabilisers. We further implement logical Pauli operations with a fidelity of $97.2(2)\\%$ within the code space. Finally, we realise the decoding circuit and recover the input state with an overall fidelity of $74.5(6)\\%$, in total with 92 gates. Our work demonstrates each key aspect of the [5, 1, 3] code and verifies the viability of experimental realisation of quantum error-correcting codes with superconducting qubits.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093/nsr/nwab011","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,15]],"date-time":"2021-01-15T12:20:13Z","timestamp":1610713213000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":"Experimental

Many applications call for error rates as low as 10<jats:sup>−15</jats:sup> (refs. <jats:sup>2–9</jats:sup>), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> (refs. <jats:sup>10–14</jats:sup>). Quantum error correction<jats:sup>15–17</jats:sup> promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on the same device<jats:sup>18,19</jats:sup> and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03588-y","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]],"date-time":"2021-07-14T16:13:39Z","timestamp":1626279219000},"page":"383-387","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":68,"title":"Exponential

The space overhead, defined as the ratio between the physical qubits to the number of output magic states, is asymptotically constant, while both the number of input magic states used per output state and the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math>-gate depth of the circuit scale linearly in the logarithm of the target error <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:math> (up to <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi></mml:math>). Unlike other distillation protocols, this protocol achieves this performance without concatenation and the input magic states are injected at various steps in the circuit rather than all at the start of the circuit. The protocol can be modified to distill magic states for other gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, with the same asymptotic performance. The protocol relies on the construction of weakly self-dual CSS codes with many logical qubits and large distance, allowing us to implement control-SWAPs on multiple qubits. We call this code the \"inner code\". The control-SWAPs are then used to measure properties of the magic state and detect errors, using another code that we call the \"outer code\". Alternatively, we use weakly-self dual CSS codes which implement controlled Hadamards for the inner code, reducing circuit depth. We present several specific small examples of this protocol.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2017-10-03-31","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,3]],"date-time":"2017-10-03T11:34:08Z","timestamp":1507030448000},"page":"31","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":38,"title":"Magic state distillation with low space overhead and optimal asymptotic input count","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Jeongwan","family":"Haah","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Quantum Architectures and Computation, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA 98052, USA"}]},{"given":"Matthew B.","family":"Hastings","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Station Q, Microsoft Research, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-6105, USA"},{"name":"Quantum Architectures and Computation, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA 98052, USA"}]},{"given":"D.","family":"Poulin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Département de Physique & Institut Quantique, Université de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada"}]},{"given":"D.","family":"Wecker","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Quantum Architectures and Computation, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA 98052, USA"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,3]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,16]],"date-time":"2018-01-16T15:52:13Z","timestamp":1516117933000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2017-10-03-31/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,3]]},"references-count":53,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2017-10-03-31","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,3]]},"article-number":"31","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2017-10-03-31","_hash":"941e3f690d13015cb506b1a17e4a6ab862fe353878a92edb40cc35fe275e9d59"},"expire":1701130965816},"doi:10.1364/OPTICA.439170":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]],"date-time":"2022-11-14T18:29:16Z","timestamp":1668450556202},"reference-count":35,"publisher":"Optica Publishing Group","issue":"2","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,2]],"date-time":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1643760000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://doi.org/10.1364/OA_License_v1#VOR-OA"}],"funder":[{"name":"National Key Research and Development (R&D) Plan of China","award":["2018YFA0306501"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100001809","name":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["11425417","12104444","11975222","U1738140"]},{"name":"Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project","award":["2019SHZDZX01"]},{"name":"Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies"},{"name":"Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds","award":["18JC1414700"]},{"name":"Key R&D Program of Guangdong province","award":["2018B030325001"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/501100002858","name":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["2021M693093"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["opg.optica.org"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,20]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>The all-photonic quantum repeater (APQR) is a promising repeater scheme to realize long-distance quantum communication. For a practical APQR, an indispensable requirement is the robustness of the repeater graph state (RGS) against photon loss. We propose a new loss-tolerant scheme by applying the generalized Shor code to RGS, which can be experimentally demonstrated with current technology. Experimentally, we first prepare and verify the nine-qubit Shor code. Then, by applying the generalized Shor code to APQR and preparing a simplified encoded RGS with the structure of <jats:inline-formula>\n      <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\">\n\t<mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n\t  <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n\t    <mml:mn>1</mml:mn>\n\t  </mml:mrow>\n\t</mml:mrow>\n\t<mml:mo>×<!-- × --></mml:mo>\n\t<mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n\t  <mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\">\n\t    <mml:mn>2</mml:mn>\n\t  </mml:mrow>\n\t</mml:mrow>\n      </mml:math>\n    </jats:inline-formula> based on the Shor code state, the effectiveness of our loss-tolerant scheme and the loss tolerance of the encoded RGS are respectively verified.

Here we demonstrate a three-qubit phase-correcting code in silicon, in which an encoded three-qubit state is protected against any phase-flip error on one of the three qubits. The correction to this encoded state is performed by a three-qubit conditional rotation, which we implement by an efficient single-step resonantly driven iToffoli gate. As expected, the error correction mitigates the errors owing to one-qubit phase-flip, as well as the intrinsic dephasing mainly owing to quasi-static phase noise.

A powerful method to suppress these effects is quantum error correction. Typically, quantum error correction is executed in discrete rounds, using entangling gates and projective measurement on ancillary qubits to complete each round of error correction. Here we use direct parity measurements to implement a continuous quantum bit-flip correction code in a resource-efficient manner, eliminating entangling gates, ancillary qubits, and their associated errors. An FPGA controller actively corrects errors as they are detected, achieving an average bit-flip detection efficiency of up to 91%. Furthermore, the protocol increases the relaxation time of the protected logical qubit by a factor of 2.7 over the relaxation times of the bare comprising qubits. Our results showcase resource-efficient stabilizer measurements in a multi-qubit architecture and demonstrate how continuous error correction codes can address challenges in realizing a fault-tolerant system.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-29906-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,28]],"date-time":"2022-04-28T10:04:48Z","timestamp":1651140288000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":"Experimental demonstration of continuous quantum error correction","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"13","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8399-0975","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"William P.","family":"Livingston","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9736-4158","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Machiel S.","family":"Blok","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Emmanuel","family":"Flurin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Justin","family":"Dressel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andrew N.","family":"Jordan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Irfan","family":"Siddiqi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,28]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Nature Communications","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29906-0.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29906-0","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29906-0.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]],"date-time":"2022-11-24T17:00:23Z","timestamp":1669309223000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29906-0"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,28]]},"references-count":45,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]}},"alternative-id":["29906"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29906-0","relation":{},"ISSN":["2041-1723"],"subject":["General Physics and Astronomy","General Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","General Chemistry","Multidisciplinary"],"container-title-short":"Nat Commun","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,28]]},"assertion":[{"value":"31 January 2022","order":1,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"6 April 2022","order":2,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"28 April 2022","order":3,"name":"first_online","label":"First Online","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"The authors declare no competing interests.","order":1,"name":"Ethics","group":{"name":"EthicsHeading","label":"Competing interests"}}],"article-number":"2307","id":"doi:10.1038/s41467-022-29906-0","_hash":"0c6435c6396560802a82b003e827bd2511595c7e5cf423ce4fa600e28202eaa3"},"expire":1701130973726},"doi:10.1038/nature14270":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T22:50:19Z","timestamp":1670021419168},"reference-count":27,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"7541","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,4]],"date-time":"2015-03-04T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1425427200000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://www.springer.com/tdm"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,4]],"date-time":"2015-03-04T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1425427200000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://www.springer.com/tdm"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["link.springer.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,5]]},"DOI":"10.1038/nature14270","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,3]],"date-time":"2015-03-03T16:48:51Z","timestamp":1425401331000},"page":"66-69","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":606,"title":"State preservation by repetitive error detection in a superconducting quantum circuit","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"519","author":[{"given":"J.","family":"Kelly","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"R.","family":"Barends","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"A.

The paper explains how Stim works and compares it to existing tools. With no foreknowledge, Stim can analyze a distance 100 surface code circuit (20 thousand qubits, 8 million gates, 1 million measurements) in 15 seconds and then begin sampling full circuit shots at a rate of 1 kHz. Stim uses a stabilizer tableau representation, similar to Aaronson and Gottesman's CHP simulator, but with three main improvements. First, Stim improves the asymptotic complexity of deterministic measurement from quadratic to linear by tracking the <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:math> of the circuit's stabilizer tableau. Second, Stim improves the constant factors of the algorithm by using a cache-friendly data layout and 256 bit wide SIMD instructions. Third, Stim only uses expensive stabilizer tableau simulation to create an initial reference sample. Further samples are collected in bulk by using that sample as a reference for batches of Pauli frames propagating through the circuit.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2021-07-06-497","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]],"date-time":"2021-07-06T09:26:56Z","timestamp":1625563616000},"page":"497","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":"Stim: a fast stabilizer circuit simulator","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Craig","family":"Gidney","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Google Inc., Santa Barbara, California 93117, USA"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-07-06-497/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]],"date-time":"2021-07-06T09:27:37Z","timestamp":1625563657000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-07-06-497/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"references-count":30,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-07-06-497","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]]},"article-number":"497","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2021-07-06-497","_hash":"a421abef10026e67ddc7ea1aab112e502632f82230348eb914ee3645740cb393"},"expire":1701130994652},"doi:10.1098/rspa.1998.0167":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]],"date-time":"2022-11-24T20:06:18Z","timestamp":1669320378762},"reference-count":49,"publisher":"The Royal Society","issue":"1969","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1998,1,8]]},"DOI":"10.1098/rspa.1998.0167","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,26]],"date-time":"2002-07-26T19:57:35Z","timestamp":1027713455000},"page":"385-410","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":603,"title":"Reliable quantum computers","prefix":"10.1098","volume":"454","author":[{"given":"John","family":"Preskill","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Charles C.

When instantiated with 3 classical LDPC codes, this \"XYZ product\" yields a non CSS quantum LDPC code which might display a large minimum distance. The simplest instance of this construction, corresponding to the product of 3 repetition codes, is a non CSS variant of the 3-dimensional toric code known as the Chamon code. The general construction was introduced in Denise Maurice's PhD thesis, but has remained poorly understood so far. The reason is that while hypergraph product codes can be analyzed with combinatorial tools, the XYZ product codes also depend crucially on the algebraic properties of the parity-check matrices of the three classical codes, making their analysis much more involved.Our main motivation for studying XYZ product codes is that the natural representatives of logical operators are two-dimensional objects. This contrasts with standard hypergraph product codes in 3 dimensions which always admit one-dimensional logical operators. In particular, specific instances of XYZ product codes with constant rate might display a minimum distance as large as <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;#x0398;</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math>. While we do not prove this result here, we obtain the dimension of a large class of XYZ product codes, and when restricting to codes with dimension 1, we reduce the problem of computing the minimum distance to a more elementary combinatorial problem involving binary 3-tensors. We also discuss in detail some families of XYZ product codes that can be embedded in three dimensions with local interaction. Some of these codes seem to share properties with Haah's cubic codes and might be interesting candidates for self-correcting quantum memories with a logarithmic energy barrier.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-07-14-766","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,14]],"date-time":"2022-07-14T13:42:11Z","timestamp":1657806131000},"page":"766","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Quantum

It has also been interpreted in a CFT context, and, in particular, holographic CFTs are expected to satisfy ETH. Recently, it was observed that the ETH condition corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition for an approximate quantum error correcting code (AQECC), implying the presence of AQECCs in systems satisfying ETH. In this paper, we explore the properties of ETH as an error correcting code and show that there exists an explicit universal recovery channel for the code. Based on the analysis, we discuss a generalization that all chaotic theories contain error correcting codes. We then specialize to AdS/CFT to demonstrate the possibility of total bulk reconstruction in black holes with a well-defined macroscopic geometry. When combined with the existing AdS/CFT error correction story, this shows that black holes are enormously robust against erasure errors.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/jhep08(2019)152","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,28]],"date-time":"2019-08-28T14:05:27Z","timestamp":1567001127000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":"Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and approximate quantum error correction","prefix":"10.1007","volume":"2019","author":[{"given":"Ning","family":"Bao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Newton","family":"Cheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Journal of High Energy Physics","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP08(2019)152.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP08(2019)152/fulltext.html","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP08(2019)152.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,3]],"date-time":"2021-09-03T17:59:42Z","timestamp":1630691982000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/JHEP08(2019)152"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8]]},"references-count":53,"journal-issue":{"issue":"8","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2019,8]]}},"alternative-id":["11156"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP08(2019)152","relation":{},"ISSN":["1029-8479"],"subject":["Nuclear and High Energy Physics"],"container-title-short":"J.

The entanglement-assisted quantum codes we describe do not require the dual-containing constraint necessary for standard quantum error–correcting codes, thus allowing us to “quantize” all of classical linear coding theory. In particular, efficient modern classical codes that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity). For systems without large amounts of shared entanglement, these codes can also be used as catalytic codes, in which a small amount of initial entanglement enables quantum communication.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1126/science.1131563","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,29]],"date-time":"2006-09-29T01:14:54Z","timestamp":1159492494000},"page":"436-439","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":259,"title":"Correcting Quantum Errors with Entanglement","prefix":"10.1126","volume":"314","author":[{"given":"Todd","family":"Brun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA."}]},{"given":"Igor","family":"Devetak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA."}]},{"given":"Min-Hsiu","family":"Hsieh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA."}]}],"member":"221","reference":[],"container-title":"Science","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1126/science.1131563","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,14]],"date-time":"2022-01-14T11:08:06Z","timestamp":1642158486000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1131563"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,20]]},"references-count":24,"journal-issue":{"issue":"5798","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,20]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1126/science.1131563"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1131563","relation":{},"ISSN":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"subject":["Multidisciplinary"],"container-title-short":"Science","published":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,20]]},"id":"doi:10.1126/science.1131563","_hash":"83e6cf1aed94388757b34f957cf623ee917b579cf575a81641457c932e133a02"},"expire":1701131033502},"doi:10.1109/TIT.2014.2313559":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,4]],"date-time":"2022-09-04T21:12:40Z","timestamp":1662325960887},"reference-count":54,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"6","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,1]],"date-time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1401580800000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html"}],"funder":[{"name":"NSF","award":["CCF-0448658"]},{"name":"NSF","award":["ECS-0507270","CCF-0524811","CCF-0545845"]},{"name":"UTS Chancellors Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship"},{"name":"UTS Early Career Researcher Grants Scheme"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2014,6]]},"DOI":"10.1109/tit.2014.2313559","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,25]],"date-time":"2014-03-25T18:09:16Z","timestamp":1395770956000},"page":"3073-3089","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":42,"title":"Catalytic Quantum Error Correction","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"60","author":[{"given":"Todd A.","family":"Brun","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Igor","family":"Devetak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Min-Hsiu","family":"Hsieh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"263","reference":[],"container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/18/6816018/06778074.pdf?arnumber=6778074","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]],"date-time":"2022-01-12T16:56:16Z","timestamp":1642006576000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6778074/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6]]},"references-count":54,"journal-issue":{"issue":"6"},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2313559","relation":{},"ISSN":["0018-9448","1557-9654"],"subject":["Library and Information Sciences","Computer Science Applications","Information Systems"],"container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the \"teraquop regime\" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably.

We show that, provided the rank of each measurement operator is sufficiently small, the transmitted data will, with high probability, be decoupled from the channel environment. We also show that our construction leads to random codes whose average input is close to a product state and outline a modification yielding unitarily invariant ensembles of maximally entangled codes. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1142/s1230161208000043","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2008,3,26]],"date-time":"2008-03-26T04:30:06Z","timestamp":1206505806000},"page":"7-19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":87,"title":"A Decoupling Approach to the Quantum Capacity","prefix":"10.1142","volume":"15","author":[{"given":"Patrick","family":"Hayden","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"}]},{"given":"Michał","family":"Horodecki","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, University of Gdańsk, Poland"},{"name":"National Quantum Information Centre of Gdańsk, Gen.

We present a scheme for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation based on quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, where long-range interactions enable many logical qubits to be encoded with a modest number of physical qubits. In our approach, logic gates operate via logical Pauli measurements that preserve both the protection of the LDPC codes and the low overheads in terms of the required number of additional qubits. Compared with surface codes with the same code distance, we estimate order-of-magnitude improvements in the overheads for processing around 100 logical qubits using this approach. Given the high thresholds demonstrated by LDPC codes, our estimates suggest that fault-tolerant quantum computation at this scale may be achievable with a few thousand physical qubits at comparable error rates to what is needed for current approaches.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abn1717","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,20]],"date-time":"2022-05-20T17:57:27Z","timestamp":1653069447000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing using long-range connectivity","prefix":"10.1126","volume":"8","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2595-4081","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Lawrence Z.","family":"Cohen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia."}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7689-3157","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Isaac H.","family":"Kim","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia."},{"name":"Department of Computer Science, UC Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA."}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4387-670X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Stephen D.","family":"Bartlett","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia."}]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8060-8109","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Benjamin J.","family":"Brown","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, School of Physics, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia."}]}],"member":"221","reference":[],"container-title":"Science Advances","original-title":[],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,20]],"date-time":"2022-05-20T17:59:00Z","timestamp":1653069540000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn1717"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,20]]},"references-count":68,"journal-issue":{"issue":"20","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,20]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1126/sciadv.abn1717"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abn1717","relation":{},"ISSN":["2375-2548"],"subject":["Multidisciplinary"],"container-title-short":"Sci.

In such codes, each qubit only affects a constant number of syndrome bits, and each syndrome bit only relies on some constant number of qubits. Constructing quantum LDPC codes is challenging. It is an open problem to understand if there exist good quantum LDPC codes, i.e. with constant rate and relative distance. Furthermore, techniques to perform fault-tolerant gates are poorly understood. We present a unified way to address these problems. Our main results are a) a bound on the distance, b) a bound on the code dimension and c) limitations on certain fault-tolerant gates that can be applied to quantum LDPC codes. All three of these bounds are cast as a function of the graph separator of the connectivity graph representation of the quantum code. We find that unless the connectivity graph contains an expander, the code is severely limited. This implies a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to construct good codes. This is the first bound that studies the limitations of quantum LDPC codes that does not rely on locality. As an application, we present novel bounds on quantum LDPC codes associated with local graphs in <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math>-dimensional hyperbolic space.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-05-13-711","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,13]],"date-time":"2022-05-13T12:50:42Z","timestamp":1652446242000},"page":"711","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Connectivity constrains quantum codes","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"6","author":[{"given":"Nouédyn","family":"Baspin","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada J1K 2R1"}]},{"given":"Anirudh","family":"Krishna","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, 94305"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,13]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-05-13-711/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,13]],"date-time":"2022-05-13T12:51:00Z","timestamp":1652446260000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-05-13-711/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,13]]},"references-count":88,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2022-05-13-711","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,13]]},"article-number":"711","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2022-05-13-711","_hash":"dd7324c9a1fa0fb5737903dda3bba833039fe97e39699cba50b7136aab63f40c"},"expire":1701131096744},"doi:10.1109/TIT.2004.834737":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T22:50:12Z","timestamp":1670021412680},"reference-count":38,"publisher":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","issue":"10","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2004,10,1]],"date-time":"2004-10-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1096588800000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/downloads/license-information/IEEE.html"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2004,10]]},"DOI":"10.1109/tit.2004.834737","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,9,28]],"date-time":"2004-09-28T13:50:38Z","timestamp":1096379438000},"page":"2315-2330","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":229,"title":"Sparse-Graph Codes for Quantum Error Correction","prefix":"10.1109","volume":"50","author":[{"given":"D.J.C.","family":"MacKay","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"G.","family":"Mitchison","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"P.L.","family":"McFadden","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"263","reference":[],"container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx5/18/29493/01337106.pdf?arnumber=1337106","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,29]],"date-time":"2021-11-29T20:46:48Z","timestamp":1638218808000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1337106/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,10]]},"references-count":38,"journal-issue":{"issue":"10","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2004,10]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2004.834737","relation":{},"ISSN":["0018-9448"],"subject":["Library and Information Sciences","Computer Science Applications","Information Systems"],"container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

We consider a generalized gauging map that does not enforce gauge symmetry at all lattice sites, and show that it is an isometry on the full input space including all charged sectors. We apply this generalized gauging map to convert global-symmetric bulk systems of holographic codes to gauge-symmetric bulk systems, and vice versa, while preserving duality with a global-symmetric boundary. We separately construct holographic codes with gauge-symmetric bulk systems by directly imposing gauge-invariance constraints onto existing holographic codes, and show that the resulting bulk gauge symmetries are dual to boundary global symmetries. Combining these ideas produces a toy model that captures several interesting features of holography — it exhibits a rudimentary sort of dynamical duality, can be modified to demonstrate the relationship between metric fluctuations and approximate error-correction, and serves as an illustration for certain no-go theorems concerning symmetries in holography. Finally, we apply the generalized gauging map to construct codes with arbitrary transversal gate sets — for any compact Lie group, we use a symmetry-preserving truncation scheme to construct covariant finite-dimensional approximate holographic codes.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/jhep05(2022)158","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,25]],"date-time":"2022-05-25T05:03:56Z","timestamp":1653455036000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Gauging the bulk: generalized gauging maps and holographic codes","prefix":"10.1007","volume":"2022","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0143-1622","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kfir","family":"Dolev","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vladimir","family":"Calvera","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Samuel S.","family":"Cree","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dominic J.","family":"Williamson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,24]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Journal of High Energy Physics","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)158.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)158/fulltext.html","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)158.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,7]],"date-time":"2022-10-07T21:18:27Z","timestamp":1665177507000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)158"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,24]]},"references-count":64,"journal-issue":{"issue":"5","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5]]}},"alternative-id":["18446"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP05(2022)158","relation":{},"ISSN":["1029-8479"],"subject":["Nuclear and High Energy Physics"],"container-title-short":"J.

The ultimate end-to-end rates of quantum communication networks are known to be achievable by an optimal entanglement distillation protocol followed by teleportation. In this work, we give a practical design for this achievability. Our ultimate design is an iterative approach, where each purification step operates on shared entangled states and detects loss errors at the highest rates allowed by physics. As a simpler design, we show that the first round of iterations can purify completely at high rates. We propose an experimental implementation using linear optics and photon-number measurements which is robust to inefficient operations and measurements, showcasing its near-term potential for real-world practical applications.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-022-00641-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,8]],"date-time":"2022-11-08T03:02:32Z","timestamp":1667876552000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Achieving the ultimate end-to-end rates of lossy quantum communication networks","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"8","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3457-4451","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Matthew S.","family":"Winnel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9990-6341","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joshua J.","family":"Guanzon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nedasadat","family":"Hosseinidehaj","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Timothy C.","family":"Ralph","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,8]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"npj Quantum Information","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00641-0.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00641-0","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00641-0.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,8]],"date-time":"2022-11-08T03:06:26Z","timestamp":1667876786000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00641-0"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,8]]},"references-count":62,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]}},"alternative-id":["641"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41534-022-00641-0","relation":{},"ISSN":["2056-6387"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","Computer Networks and Communications","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Computer Science (miscellaneous)"],"container-title-short":"npj Quantum Inf","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,8]]},"assertion":[{"value":"25 March 2022","order":1,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"14 October 2022","order":2,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"8 November 2022","order":3,"name":"first_online","label":"First Online","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"The authors declare no competing interests.","order":1,"name":"Ethics","group":{"name":"EthicsHeading","label":"Competing interests"}}],"article-number":"129","id":"doi:10.1038/s41534-022-00641-0","_hash":"2005456e99b1fa2b5ea95b41e47a6596f58c05a86a2dd03690e8ab21ac06eefe"},"expire":1701131110815},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.4556":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,2]],"date-time":"2022-12-02T22:56:07Z","timestamp":1670021767715},"reference-count":19,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"22","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[1999,5,31]],"date-time":"1999-05-31T00:00:00Z","timestamp":928108800000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://link.aps.org/licenses/aps-default-license"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1103/physrevlett.82.4556","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,26]],"date-time":"2002-07-26T22:16:54Z","timestamp":1027721814000},"page":"4556-4559","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":226,"title":"Concatenating Decoherence-Free Subspaces with Quantum Error Correcting Codes","prefix":"10.1103","volume":"82","author":[{"given":"D.

In situations where the Heisenberg scaling is achievable, we provide a semidefinite program to identify the optimal quantum error correcting (QEC) protocol that yields the best estimation precision. We overcome the technical challenges associated with potential incompatibility of the measurement optimally extracting information on different parameters by utilizing the Holevo Cramér-Rao (HCR) bound for pure states. We provide examples of significant advantages offered by our joint-QEC protocols, that sense all the parameters utilizing a single error-corrected subspace, over separate-QEC protocols where each

The need for understanding the limits of covariant quantum error correction arises in various realms of physics including fault-tolerant quantum computation, condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. Here, we explore covariant quantum error correction with respect to continuous symmetries from the perspectives of quantum metrology and quantum resource theory, establishing solid connections between these formerly disparate fields. We prove new and powerful lower bounds on the infidelity of covariant quantum error correction, which not only extend the scope of previous no-go results but also provide a substantial improvement over existing bounds. Explicit lower bounds are derived for both erasure and depolarizing noises. We also present a type of covariant codes which nearly saturates these lower bounds.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2021-08-09-521","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]],"date-time":"2021-08-09T11:21:59Z","timestamp":1628508119000},"page":"521","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":"New perspectives on covariant quantum error correction","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Sisi","family":"Zhou","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511, USA"},{"name":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, The University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA"}]},{"given":"Zi-Wen","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 2Y5, Canada"}]},{"given":"Liang","family":"Jiang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, The University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-08-09-521/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]],"date-time":"2021-08-09T11:22:29Z","timestamp":1628508149000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-08-09-521/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"references-count":75,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-08-09-521","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"article-number":"521","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2021-08-09-521","_hash":"9bd5abea15d714534b86dd72ce9f62681591e37ea682736b8597809e90997059"},"expire":1701131126765},"doi:10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,18]],"date-time":"2022-11-18T20:10:44Z","timestamp":1668802244405},"reference-count":44,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"10","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,6]],"date-time":"2018-08-06T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1533513600000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["link.springer.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"DOI":"10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,6]],"date-time":"2018-08-06T06:35:02Z","timestamp":1533537302000},"page":"2955-2978","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":46,"title":"Universal Recovery Maps and Approximate Sufficiency of Quantum Relative Entropy","prefix":"10.1007","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"Marius","family":"Junge","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Renato","family":"Renner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"David","family":"Sutter","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mark M.","family":"Wilde","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andreas","family":"Winter","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,6]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Annales Henri Poincaré","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0/fulltext.html","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,5]],"date-time":"2019-08-05T19:14:50Z","timestamp":1565032490000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,6]]},"references-count":44,"journal-issue":{"issue":"10","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]}},"alternative-id":["716"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00023-018-0716-0","relation":{},"ISSN":["1424-0637","1424-0661"],"subject":["Mathematical Physics","Nuclear and High Energy Physics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics"],"container-title-short":"Ann.

In particular, several researchers have considered the individual code qubits being encoded with the continuous variable GottesmanKitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, and then imposed an outer discrete-variable code such as the surface code on these GKP qubits. Under such a concatenation scheme, the analog information from the inner GKP error correction improves the noise threshold of the outer code. However, the surface code has vanishing rate and demands a lot of resources with growing distance. In this work, we concatenate the GKP code with generic quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes and demonstrate a natural way to exploit the GKP analog information in iterative decoding algorithms. We first show the noise thresholds for two lifted product QLDPC code families, and then show the improvements of noise thresholds when the iterative decoder – a hardware-friendly min-sum algorithm (MSA) – utilizes the GKP analog information. We also show that, when the GKP analog information is combined with a sequential update schedule for MSA, the scheme surpasses the well-known CSS Hamming bound for these code families. Furthermore, we observe that the GKP analog information helps the iterative decoder in escaping harmful trapping sets in the Tanner graph of the QLDPC code, thereby eliminating or significantly lowering the error floor of the logical error rate curves. Finally, we discuss new fundamental and practical questions that arise from this work on channel capacity under GKP analog information, and on improving decoder design and analysis.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-07-20-767","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]],"date-time":"2022-07-20T13:39:18Z","timestamp":1658324358000},"page":"767","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"Finite Rate QLDPC-GKP Coding Scheme that Surpasses the CSS Hamming Bound","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"6","author":[{"given":"Nithin","family":"Raveendran","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA"}]},{"given":"Narayanan","family":"Rengaswamy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA"}]},{"given":"Filip","family":"Rozpędek","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA"}]},{"given":"Ankur","family":"Raina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh 462066, India"}]},{"given":"Liang","family":"Jiang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA"}]},{"given":"Bane","family":"Vasić","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-07-20-767/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]],"date-time":"2022-07-20T13:39:45Z","timestamp":1658324385000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-07-20-767/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]]},"references-count":61,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2022-07-20-767","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]]},"article-number":"767","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2022-07-20-767","_hash":"ca5bd48b8ce93634d7f330cfc52b3ed2807a4b0ea66d8b9ed78b62bc66d86df1"},"expire":1701131137683},"doi:10.22331/q-2022-02-10-648":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,20]],"date-time":"2022-05-20T14:49:34Z","timestamp":1653058174421},"reference-count":53,"publisher":"Verein zur Forderung des Open Access Publizierens in den Quantenwissenschaften","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,10]],"date-time":"2022-02-10T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1644451200000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}],"funder":[{"name":"BMBF","award":["RealistiQ"]},{"name":"BMBF","award":["PhoQuant"]},{"name":"BMBF","award":["QPIC-1"]},{"name":"BMBF","award":["QSolid"]},{"name":"DFG","award":["CRC 183"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["quantum-journal.org"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"abstract":"<jats:p>We examine general Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes for continuous-variable quantum error correction, including concatenated GKP codes, through the lens of lattice theory, in order to better understand the structure of this class of stabilizer codes.

However, no concrete architecture has been presented so far that exploits both the advantages of qubits encoded into states of light and the modern tools for their generation. Here we propose such a design for a scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer informed by the latest developments in theory and technology. Central to our architecture is the generation and manipulation of three-dimensional resource states comprising both bosonic qubits and squeezed vacuum states. The proposal exploits state-of-the-art procedures for the non-deterministic generation of bosonic qubits combined with the strengths of continuous-variable quantum computation, namely the implementation of Clifford gates using easy-to-generate squeezed states. Moreover, the architecture is based on two-dimensional integrated photonic chips used to produce a qubit cluster state in one temporal and two spatial dimensions. By reducing the experimental challenges as compared to existing architectures and by enabling room-temperature quantum computation, our design opens the door to scalable fabrication and operation, which may allow photonics to leap-frog other platforms on the path to a quantum computer with millions of qubits.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2021-02-04-392","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]],"date-time":"2021-02-04T19:35:27Z","timestamp":1612467327000},"page":"392","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":66,"title":"Blueprint for a Scalable Photonic Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"5","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4333-5006","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"J.

Such quantum systems must be made from robust hardware that can coherently store, process, and extract the encoded information, as well as possess effective quantum error correction (QEC) protocols to detect and correct errors. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides a promising hardware platform for implementing robust quantum devices. In particular, bosonic encodings in cQED that use multi-photon states of superconducting cavities to encode information have shown success in realizing hardware-efficient QEC.

Despite its simplicity compared with the conventional measurement-based quantum error correction, it is still a far from practical technique because of significant hardware overhead. We propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme for a rotational symmetric bosonic code in a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator. Our scheme is the simplest possible error correction scheme that can surpass the break-even point—it requires only a single continuous microwave tone. We also introduce an unconditional reset scheme that requires one more continuous microwave tone in addition to that for the error correction. The key properties underlying this simplicity are protected quasienergy states of a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator and the degeneracy in its quasienergy level structure. These properties eliminate the need for state-by-state correction in the Fock basis. Our schemes greatly reduce the complexity of autonomous quantum error correction and thus may accelerate the use of the bosonic code for practical quantum computation.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-022-00553-z","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,22]],"date-time":"2022-04-22T10:09:45Z","timestamp":1650622185000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"Autonomous quantum error correction in a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"8","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8113-0821","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sangil","family":"Kwon","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2895-698X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shohei","family":"Watabe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jaw-Shen","family":"Tsai","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,22]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"npj Quantum Information","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00553-z.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00553-z","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00553-z.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,24]],"date-time":"2022-11-24T18:47:08Z","timestamp":1669315628000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-022-00553-z"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,22]]},"references-count":86,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]}},"alternative-id":["553"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41534-022-00553-z","relation":{},"ISSN":["2056-6387"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","Computer Networks and Communications","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Computer Science (miscellaneous)"],"container-title-short":"npj Quantum Inf","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,22]]},"assertion":[{"value":"29 October 2021","order":1,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"17 March 2022","order":2,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"22 April 2022","order":3,"name":"first_online","label":"First Online","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"The authors declare no competing interests.","order":1,"name":"Ethics","group":{"name":"EthicsHeading","label":"Competing interests"}}],"article-number":"40","id":"doi:10.1038/s41534-022-00553-z","_hash":"65263046f0d61472801e37740918339117b71a08897f080e2631be658c0b7062"},"expire":1701131167918},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031006":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,1]],"date-time":"2022-12-01T18:26:02Z","timestamp":1669919162917},"reference-count":111,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"3","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,14]],"date-time":"2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1468454400000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/100000879","name":"Alfred P.

In particular, the ground space is thought to yield a quantum error-correcting code. We offer an explicit proof that this is the case for arbitrary finite groups. Actually a stronger claim is shown: any two states with zero energy density in some contractible region must have the same reduced state in that region. Alternatively, the local properties of a gauge-invariant state are fully determined by specifying that its holonomies in the region are trivial. We contrast this result with the fact that local properties of gauge-invariant states are not generally determined by specifying all of their non-Abelian fluxes --- that is, the Wilson loops of lattice gauge theory do not form a complete commuting set of observables. We also note that the methods developed by P. Naaijkens (PhD thesis, 2012) under a different context can be adapted to provide another proof of the error correcting property of Kitaev's model. Finally, we compute the topological entanglement entropy in Kitaev's model, and show, contrary to previous claims in the literature, that it does not depend on whether the ``log dim R'' term is included in the definition of entanglement entropy.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2020-09-24-331","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]],"date-time":"2020-09-24T14:27:59Z","timestamp":1600957679000},"page":"331","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":"Kitaev's quantum double model as an error correcting code","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"4","author":[{"given":"Shawn X.","family":"Cui","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Departments of Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907"}]},{"given":"Dawei","family":"Ding","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305"}]},{"given":"Xizhi","family":"Han","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305"}]},{"given":"Geoffrey","family":"Penington","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305"}]},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Ranard","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305"}]},{"given":"Brandon C.","family":"Rayhaun","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305"}]},{"given":"Zhou","family":"Shangnan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-09-24-331/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]],"date-time":"2020-09-24T14:28:08Z","timestamp":1600957688000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-09-24-331/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]]},"references-count":27,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2020-09-24-331","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,24]]},"article-number":"331","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2020-09-24-331","_hash":"3e69dda9f4c53ddb24597dfeec958cc6da507e645fe0d07a129e2cf46bbf3be3"},"expire":1701131200817},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.69.032306":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]],"date-time":"2022-04-01T02:17:28Z","timestamp":1648779448194},"reference-count":10,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"3","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,11]],"date-time":"2004-03-11T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1078963200000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://link.aps.org/licenses/aps-default-license"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1103/physreva.69.032306","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,12]],"date-time":"2004-03-12T04:13:46Z","timestamp":1079064826000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":50,"title":"Anyon computers with smaller groups","prefix":"10.1103","volume":"69","author":[{"given":"Carlos","family":"Mochon","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"16","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,11]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Physical Review A","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevA.69.032306","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://harvest.aps.org/v2/journals/articles/10.1103/PhysRevA.69.032306/fulltext","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,23]],"date-time":"2018-04-23T05:03:11Z","timestamp":1524459791000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.69.032306"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,11]]},"references-count":10,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2004,3]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.69.032306","relation":{},"ISSN":["1050-2947","1094-1622"],"subject":["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Phys.

Here we consider qubits encoded with constant space overhead (i.e. finite encoding rate) in the limit of arbitrarily large code distance<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math>through the use of topological codes associated to triangulations of hyperbolic surfaces. We introduce explicit protocols to demonstrate how Dehn twists of the hyperbolic surface can be implemented on the code through constant depth unitary circuits, without increasing the space overhead. The circuit for a given Dehn twist consists of a permutation of physical qubits, followed by a constant depth local unitary circuit, where locality here is defined with respect to a hyperbolic metric that defines the code. Applying our results to the hyperbolic Fibonacci Turaev-Viro code implies the possibility of applying universal logical gate sets on encoded qubits through constant depth unitary circuits and with constant space overhead. Our circuits are inherently protected from errors as they map local operators to local operators while changing the size of their support by at most a constant factor; in the presence of noisy syndrome measurements, our results suggest the possibility of universal fault tolerant quantum computation with constant space overhead and time overhead of<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mi class=\"MJX-tex-caligraphic\" mathvariant=\"script\">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:math>.

A transistor, despite its roots in energy band structure, does not invoke quantum mechanically coherent transmission between terminals. The impressive progress in the past decade in mesoscopic physics, when combined with studies that have analysed a totally quantum mechanical computational process, suggest that we may be ready to move toward more quantum mechanical procedures for information processing. This paper is a warning signal; this possibility is beset by problems. The case will be made via two separate but complementary arguments. First, by summarizing this author's published comments on computation via totally quantum mechanical coherent Hamiltonians. The computation is likely to suffer from\n            <jats:italic>localization</jats:italic>\n            , i.e. from reflection of the computational trajectory, causing the computation to turn around. Additionally, small errors will accumulate and cause the computation to go off track. This is supplemented by analysis of specific proposals that suggest more detailed machinery than invoked in the general literature on quantum mechanical Hamiltonian computation.\n          </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1098/rsta.1995.0106","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,12,15]],"date-time":"2006-12-15T19:15:05Z","timestamp":1166210105000},"page":"367-376","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":101,"title":"Is quantum mechanics useful?","prefix":"10.1098","volume":"353","member":"175","published-online":{"date-parts":[[1997,1]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This learning problem is a natural extension of the “learning from parity with error” problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a\n            <jats:italic>quantum</jats:italic>\n            algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP.

Here we study the problem of designing logical operations for quantum error correcting codes. We present an automated procedure that generates logical operations given known encoding and correcting procedures. Our technique is to use variational circuits for learning both the logical gates and the physical operations implementing them. This procedure can be implemented on near-term quantum computers via quantum process tomography. It enables automatic discovery of logical gates from analytically designed error correcting codes and can be extended to error correcting codes found by numerical optimization. We test the procedure by simulating small quantum codes of four to fifteen qubits showing that our procedure finds most logical gates known in the current literature. Additionally, it generates logical gates not found in the current literature for the [[5,1,2]] code, the [[6,3,2]] code, the [[8,3,2]] code, and the [[10,1,2]] code.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.26421/qic22.11-12-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]],"date-time":"2022-09-27T03:32:00Z","timestamp":1664249520000},"page":"947-964","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Automated discovery of logical gates for quantum error correction (with Supplementary (153 pages))","prefix":"10.26421","volume":"22","author":[{"given":"Hongxiang","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Vasmer","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nikolas P.","family":"Breuckmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Edward","family":"Grant","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"10955","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"container-title":"Quantum Information and Computation","original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]],"date-time":"2022-09-27T03:32:05Z","timestamp":1664249525000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.rintonpress.com/journals/doi/QIC22.11-12-3.html"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"11&12","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.26421/QIC22.11-12-3","relation":{},"ISSN":["1533-7146"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","General Physics and Astronomy","Mathematical Physics","Nuclear and High Energy Physics","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Theoretical Computer Science"],"container-title-short":"QIC","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,8]]},"reference":[],"id":"doi:10.26421/QIC22.11-12-3","_hash":"c1a0a4c1bebb6ab68dfa6cf34961c5909430e9063835f2b54d1731f7b69b45fd"},"expire":1702831914719},"doi:10.1038/s41534-018-0085-z":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,21]],"date-time":"2022-12-21T05:48:38Z","timestamp":1671601718358},"reference-count":19,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"1","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,12]],"date-time":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1536710400000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,12]],"date-time":"2018-09-12T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1536710400000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/100000001","name":"National Science Foundation","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["CCF-1254119","CCF-1254119"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000183","name":"DOD | Army Research Office","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["W911NF-12-1-0541","W911NF-12-1-0541"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["link.springer.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Reliable qubits are difficult to engineer, but standard fault-tolerance schemes use seven or more physical qubits to encode each logical qubit, with still more qubits required for error correction. The large overhead makes it hard to experiment with fault-tolerance schemes with multiple encoded qubits. Here, we study the 15-qubit Hamming code, which protects seven encoded qubits to distance three. We give fault-tolerant procedures for applying arbitrary Clifford operations on these encoded qubits, using only two extra qubits, 17 in total. In particular, individual encoded qubits within the code block can be targeted. Fault-tolerant universal computation is possible with four extra qubits, 19 in total. The procedures could enable testing more sophisticated protected circuits in small-scale quantum devices. Our main technique is to use gadgets to protect gates against correlated faults. We also take advantage of special code symmetries, and use pieceable fault tolerance.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-018-0085-z","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,6]],"date-time":"2018-09-06T07:46:02Z","timestamp":1536219962000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":55,"title":"Fault-tolerant quantum computation with few qubits","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"4","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2570-2426","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Rui","family":"Chao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ben W.","family":"Reichardt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,12]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"npj Quantum Information","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0085-z.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0085-z","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0085-z.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,20]],"date-time":"2022-12-20T23:02:22Z","timestamp":1671577342000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0085-z"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,12]]},"references-count":19,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]}},"alternative-id":["85"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41534-018-0085-z","relation":{},"ISSN":["2056-6387"],"subject":["Computational Theory and Mathematics","Computer Networks and Communications","Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Computer Science (miscellaneous)"],"container-title-short":"npj Quantum Inf","published":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,12]]},"assertion":[{"value":"22 December 2017","order":1,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"21 June 2018","order":2,"name":"revised","label":"Revised","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"5 July 2018","order":3,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"12 September 2018","order":4,"name":"first_online","label":"First Online","group":{"name":"ArticleHistory","label":"Article History"}},{"value":"The authors declare no competing interests.","order":1,"name":"Ethics","group":{"name":"EthicsHeading","label":"Competing interests"}}],"article-number":"42","id":"doi:10.1038/s41534-018-0085-z","_hash":"d18c301ea384ae1d8742f39e0e24e389f24f829418a207eb6af5903bab464426"},"expire":1702831915739},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.54.4741":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,8]],"date-time":"2022-12-08T15:28:20Z","timestamp":1670513300426},"reference-count":9,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"6","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[1996,12,1]],"date-time":"1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":849398400000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://link.aps.org/licenses/aps-default-license"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1103/physreva.54.4741","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,27]],"date-time":"2002-07-27T02:27:51Z","timestamp":1027736871000},"page":"4741-4751","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":243,"title":"Simple quantum error-correcting codes","prefix":"10.1103","volume":"54","author":[{"given":"A.

We first show that using open-boundary MPS to define boundary to bulk encoding maps yields at most constant distance error-detecting codes. These are degenerate ground spaces of gapped local Hamiltonians. To get around this no-go result, we consider excited states, i.e., we use the excitation ansatz to construct encoding maps: these yield error-detecting codes with distance Ω(<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>\n            <jats:sup>1−ν</jats:sup> ) for any <jats:italic>ν</jats:italic> ∈ (0<jats:italic>,</jats:italic> 1) and Ω(log <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>) encoded qubits. This shows that gapped systems contain — within isolated energy bands — error-detecting codes spanned by momentum eigenstates. We also consider the gapless Heisenberg-XXX model, whose energy eigenstates can be described via Bethe ansatz tensor networks. We show that it contains — within its low-energy eigenspace — an error-detecting code with the same parameter scaling. All these codes detect arbitrary <jats:italic>d</jats:italic>-local (not necessarily geometrically local) errors even though they are not permutation-invariant. This suggests that a wide range of naturally occurring many-body systems possess intrinsic error-detecting features.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007/jhep09(2019)021","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,5]],"date-time":"2019-09-05T15:02:47Z","timestamp":1567695767000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":"Quantum error-detection at low energies","prefix":"10.1007","volume":"2019","author":[{"given":"Martina","family":"Gschwendtner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Robert","family":"König","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Burak","family":"Şahinoğlu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eugene","family":"Tang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Journal of High Energy Physics","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP09(2019)021.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2019)021/fulltext.html","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP09(2019)021.pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,3]],"date-time":"2021-09-03T18:13:22Z","timestamp":1630692802000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/JHEP09(2019)021"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9]]},"references-count":79,"journal-issue":{"issue":"9","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2019,9]]}},"alternative-id":["11204"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP09(2019)021","relation":{},"ISSN":["1029-8479"],"subject":["Nuclear and High Energy Physics"],"container-title-short":"J.

So far, photon loss has been the dominant source of errors in bosonic qubits, but the significant reduction of photon loss in recent bosonic qubit experiments suggests that dephasing errors should also be considered. However, a detailed understanding of the combined photon loss and dephasing channel is lacking. Here, we show that, unlike its constituent parts, the combined loss-dephasing channel is non-degradable, pointing towards a richer structure of this channel. We provide bounds for the capacity of the loss-dephasing channel and use numerical optimization to find optimal single-mode codes for a wide range of error rates.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-09-29-821","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]],"date-time":"2022-09-29T12:26:49Z","timestamp":1664454409000},"page":"821","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Quantum capacity and codes for the bosonic loss-dephasing channel","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"6","author":[{"given":"Peter","family":"Leviant","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel"}]},{"given":"Qian","family":"Xu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA"}]},{"given":"Liang","family":"Jiang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA"}]},{"given":"Serge","family":"Rosenblum","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel"}]}],"member":"9598","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-09-29-821/pdf/","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]],"date-time":"2022-09-29T12:27:53Z","timestamp":1664454473000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-09-29-821/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]},"references-count":35,"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2022-09-29-821","relation":{},"ISSN":["2521-327X"],"subject":["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]},"article-number":"821","id":"doi:10.22331/q-2022-09-29-821","_hash":"96bec0481798cafaafa0b8232d56dfde88a97b3fa589719107cd558c8b584d64"},"expire":1703605021421},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.106.105007":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,11]],"date-time":"2022-11-11T05:52:54Z","timestamp":1668145974433},"reference-count":40,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"10","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,10]],"date-time":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1668038400000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/100000001","name":"National Science Foundation","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["PHY-1911298"]},{"DOI":"10.13039/100000015","name":"U.S. Department of Energy","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["DE- SC0007884"]},{"name":"QuantiSED Fermilab consortium"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["journals.aps.org"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"DOI":"10.1103/physrevd.106.105007","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,10]],"date-time":"2022-11-10T15:03:08Z","timestamp":1668092588000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Renormalization group and approximate error correction","prefix":"10.1103","volume":"106","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1289-6831","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Keiichiro","family":"Furuya","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3446-5933","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Nima","family":"Lashkari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mudassir","family":"Moosa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"16","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,10]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Physical Review D","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.105007","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://harvest.aps.org/v2/journals/articles/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.105007/fulltext","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,10]],"date-time":"2022-11-10T15:03:15Z","timestamp":1668092595000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.105007"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,10]]},"references-count":40,"journal-issue":{"issue":"10","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.105007","relation":{},"ISSN":["2470-0010","2470-0029"],"container-title-short":"Phys.

We propose a new encryption with a public key matrix by considering the adding of a random distortion matrix over     F  q m      of full column rank n. We show that IND-CPA security is achievable for our encryption under assumption of the Decisional Rank Syndrome Decoding problem. Furthermore, we also prove some bounds for the number of matrices of a fixed rank with entries over a finite field. Our proposal allows the choice of the error terms with rank up to     r 2    , where r is the error-correcting capability of a code.

Quantum measurements to discriminate multiple states at the single-photon level are essential for optimizing information transfer in low-power optical communications and quantum communications, and can enhance the capabilities of many quantum information protocols. Here, we theoretically investigate and experimentally demonstrate the discrimination of multiple coherent states of light with sensitivities surpassing the quantum noise limit (QNL) at the single-photon level under realistic conditions of loss and noise based on strategies implementing globally-optimized adaptive measurements with single photon counting and displacement operations. These discrimination strategies can provide realistic advantages to enhance information transfer at low powers, and are compatible with photon number resolving detection, which provides robustness at high powers, thus allowing for surpassing the QNL at arbitrary input power levels under realistic conditions.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-017-0042-2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,9]],"date-time":"2017-10-09T16:04:29Z","timestamp":1507565069000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":23,"title":"Multi-state discrimination below the quantum noise limit at the single-photon level","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"A.

Bosonic phase noise channels, a class of non-Gaussian channels, have emerged as a relevant noise model in quantum information and optical communication. However, while the fundamental limits for communication over Gaussian channels have been extensively studied, the properties of communication over Bosonic phase noise channels are not well understood. Here we propose and demonstrate experimentally the concept of optimized communication strategies for communication over phase noise channels to enhance information transfer beyond what is possible with conventional methods of modulation and detection. Two key ingredients are generalized constellations of coherent states that interpolate between standard on-off keying and binary phase-shift keying formats, and non-Gaussian measurements based on photon number resolving detection of the coherently displaced signal. For a given power constraint and channel noise strength, these novel strategies rely on joint optimization of the input alphabet and the measurement to provide enhanced communication capability over a non-Gaussian channel characterized in terms of the error rate as well as mutual information.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-019-0177-4","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]],"date-time":"2019-07-31T10:02:57Z","timestamp":1564567377000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":28,"title":"Optimized communication strategies with binary coherent states over phase noise channels","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"M.

The new scheme combines the advantages of LDPC codes, a priori error rate estimation, rate-adaptive and blind information reconciliation techniques. We compare the performance of several asymmetric and symmetric error correction schemes using a real industrial QKD setup. The proposed asymmetric algorithm achieves significantly higher throughput, providing a secret key rate that is close to the symmetric one in a wide range of error rates. Thus, our approach is found to be particularly efficient for applications with high key rates, limited classical channel capacity and asymmetric computational resource

The data and ancilla qubits of the small stellated dodecahedron code can be located on the edges respectively vertices of a small stellated dodecahedron, making this code suitable for three-dimensional connectivity. This code encodes eight logical qubits into 30 physical qubits (plus 22 ancilla qubits for parity check measurements) in contrast with one logical qubit into nine physical qubits (plus eight ancilla qubits) for the surface code.

We give an introduction to the theory of anyon models, providing all the formalism necessary to apply standard quantum measurement theory to such systems. This formalism is then applied to give a detailed analysis of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for arbitrary anyon models. In this treatment, we find that the collapse behavior exhibited by a target anyon in a superposition of states is determined by the monodromy of the probe anyons with the target. Such measurements may also be used to gain knowledge that would help to properly identify the anyon model describing an unknown system. The techniques used and results obtained from this model interferometer have general applicability, and we use them to also describe the interferometry measurements in a two point-contact interferometer proposed for non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states. Additionally, we give the complete description of a number of important examples of anyon models, as well as their corresponding quantities that are relevant for interferometry. Finally, we give a partial classification of anyon models with small numbers of particle types.","DOI":"10.7907/5NDZ-W890","publisher":"California Institute of Technology","title":"Non-Abelian Anyons and Interferometry","URL":"https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechETD:etd-06042007-101617","copyright":"No commercial reproduction, distribution, display or performance rights in this work are provided.","version":"Final","reference":[],"_hash":"945aff280ddabba6091440ae1d06301a9fffd6edf79c4bf91387ffd4f654cc13"},"expire":1708162716684},"doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.55.900":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,21]],"date-time":"2023-02-21T09:11:40Z","timestamp":1676970700992},"reference-count":21,"publisher":"American Physical Society (APS)","issue":"2","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[1997,2,1]],"date-time":"1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":854755200000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http://link.aps.org/licenses/aps-default-license"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.1103/physreva.55.900","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,27]],"date-time":"2002-07-27T02:27:51Z","timestamp":1027736871000},"page":"900-911","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":922,"title":"Theory of quantum error-correcting codes","prefix":"10.1103","volume":"55","author":[{"given":"Emanuel","family":"Knill","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Raymond","family":"Laflamme","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"16","published-online":{"date-parts":[[1997,2,1]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Physical Review A","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevA.55.900","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"http://harvest.aps.org/v2/journals/articles/10.1103/PhysRevA.55.900/fulltext","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,15]],"date-time":"2017-06-15T08:47:24Z","timestamp":1497516444000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.55.900"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,2,1]]},"references-count":21,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-print":{"date-parts":[[1997,2]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.55.900","relation":{},"ISSN":["1050-2947","1094-1622"],"subject":["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Phys.

A recent work by Fawzi, Grospellier and Leverrier (FOCS 2018) building on a result by Gottesman (QIC 2013) has shown that the space overhead can be asymptotically reduced to a constant independent of the circuit provided we only consider circuits with a length bounded by a polynomial in the width. In this work, using a minimal model for quantum fault tolerance, we establish a general lower bound on the space overhead required to achieve fault tolerance. \r\nFor any non-unitary qubit channel 𝒩 and any quantum fault tolerance schemes against i.i.d. noise modeled by 𝒩, we prove a lower bound of max{Q(𝒩)^{-1}n,α_𝒩 log T} on the number of physical qubits, for circuits of length T and width n. Here, Q(𝒩) denotes the quantum capacity of 𝒩 and α_𝒩 > 0 is a constant only depending on the channel 𝒩. In our model, we allow for qubits to be replaced by fresh ones during the execution of the circuit and in the case of unital noise, we allow classical computation to be free and perfect. This improves upon results that assumed classical computations to be also affected by noise, and that sometimes did not allow for fresh qubits to be added. Along the way, we prove an exponential upper bound on the maximal length of fault-tolerant quantum computation with amplitude damping noise resolving a conjecture by Ben-Or, Gottesman and Hassidim (2013).","container-title":"Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik","DOI":"10.4230/LIPICS.ITCS.2022.68","publisher":"Schloss Dagstuhl - Leibniz-Zentrum für Informatik","title":"A Lower Bound on the Space Overhead of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation","URL":"https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/15664/","copyright":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license","reference":[],"_hash":"8d2072ca718b40d6ed2fb41d2639e0d4f5ab8c9bdacc01ade7c83a8eb6094767"},"expire":1708162723057},"doi:10.22331/q-2022-10-06-828":{"value":{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,1]],"date-time":"2023-02-01T11:10:18Z","timestamp":1675249818437},"reference-count":202,"publisher":"Verein zur Forderung des Open Access Publizierens in den Quantenwissenschaften","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1665014400000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039/501100001870","name":"the Foundation for Polish Science","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["MAB/2018/5"]},{"name":"General Research Fund","award":["GRF/16305121"]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["quantum-journal.org"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"abstract":"<jats:p>Quantum error correction is believed to be a necessity for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the past two decades, various constructions of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) have been developed, leading to many good code families. However, the majority of these codes are not suitable for near-term quantum devices. Here we present VarQEC, a noise-resilient variational quantum algorithm to search for quantum codes with a hardware-efficient encoding circuit. The cost functions are inspired by the most general and fundamental requirements of a QECC, the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Given the target noise channel (or the target code parameters) and the hardware connectivity graph, we optimize a shallow variational quantum circuit to prepare the basis states of an eligible code. In principle, VarQEC can find quantum codes for any error model, whether additive or non-additive, degenerate or non-degenerate, pure or impure. We have verified its effectiveness by (re)discovering some symmetric and asymmetric codes, e.g., <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow class=\"MJX-TeXAtom-ORD\"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>&amp;#x2212;</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math> for <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math> from 7 to 14.

Recently, new stabilizer codes for scalable circuit-based quantum computation have been introduced that have very high thresholds under biased noise where the qubit predominantly suffers from one type of error, e.g. dephasing. However, extending these advances in stabilizer codes to generate high-threshold cluster states for biased noise has been a challenge, as the standard method for foliating stabilizer codes to generate fault-tolerant cluster states does not preserve the noise bias. In this work, we overcome this barrier by introducing a generalization of the cluster state that allows us to foliate stabilizer codes in a bias-preserving way. As an example of our approach, we construct a foliated version of the XZZX code which we call the XZZX cluster state. We demonstrate that under a circuit-level-noise model, our XZZX cluster state has a threshold more than double the usual cluster state when dephasing errors are more likely than errors that cause bit flips by a factor of order ~100 or more.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-023-00677-w","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,31]],"date-time":"2023-01-31T14:05:51Z","timestamp":1675173951000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Tailored cluster states with high threshold under biased noise","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"9","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6711-4585","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jahan","family":"Claes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"J.

We find that any multiqubit Pauli operator overlapping with the MEMs exhibits a uniform late-time decay rate comparable to single-qubit relaxation rates, irrespective of its size or composition. This characteristic allows us to accurately reconstruct the exponentially localized spatial profiles of the MEMs. Furthermore, the MEMs are found to be resilient against certain symmetry-breaking noise owing to a prethermalization mechanism.

Unfortunately, their exchange that can reveal their exotic statistics needs manipulations that are still beyond our experimental capabilities. Here we take an alternative approach. Through the Jordan–Wigner transformation, the Kitaev's chain supporting two Majorana zero modes is mapped to the spin-1/2 chain. We experimentally simulated the spin system and its evolution with a photonic quantum simulator. This allows us to probe the geometric phase, which corresponds to the exchange of two Majorana zero modes positioned at the ends of a three-site chain. Finally, we demonstrate the immunity of quantum information encoded in the Majorana zero modes against local errors through the simulator. Our photonic simulator opens the way for the efficient realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes in complex architectures.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms13194","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,25]],"date-time":"2016-10-25T09:37:45Z","timestamp":1477388265000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":34,"title":"Simulating

For most known cases, we prove that they are the unique global minima for energy, as long as the potential function is strictly completely monotonic. For certain potential functions, some of these configurations were previously analyzed by Yudin, Kolushov, and Andreev; we build on their techniques. We also generalize our results to other compact two-point homogeneous spaces, and we conclude with an extension to Euclidean space.</p>","DOI":"10.1090/s0894-0347-06-00546-7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2006,10,14]],"date-time":"2006-10-14T01:46:17Z","timestamp":1160790377000},"page":"99-148","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":193,"title":"Universally optimal distribution of points on spheres","prefix":"10.1090","volume":"20","author":[{"given":"Henry","family":"Cohn","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Abhinav","family":"Kumar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"14","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,5]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Journal of the American Mathematical Society","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http://www.ams.org/jams/2007-20-01/S0894-0347-06-00546-7/S0894-0347-06-00546-7.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://www.ams.org/jams/2007-20-01/S0894-0347-06-00546-7/S0894-0347-06-00546-7.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]],"date-time":"2021-07-29T21:43:35Z","timestamp":1627595015000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.ams.org/jams/2007-20-01/S0894-0347-06-00546-7/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,9,5]]},"references-count":62,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2007,1]]}},"alternative-id":["S0894-0347-06-00546-7"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0894-0347-06-00546-7","relation":{},"ISSN":["0894-0347","1088-6834"],"subject":["Applied Mathematics","General Mathematics"],"container-title-short":"J.

In doing so, we achieve the record energy sensitivity for telecom receivers. We investigate the trade-off between energy and bandwidth use and its dependence on the alphabet length.

Typical measurement paradigms for state discrimination involve a minimum probability of error or unambiguous discrimination with a minimum probability of inconclusive results. Alternatively, an optimal inconclusive measurement, a non-projective measurement, achieves minimal error for a given inconclusive probability. This more general measurement encompasses the standard measurement paradigms for state discrimination and provides a much more powerful tool for quantum information and communication. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal inconclusive measurement for the discrimination of binary coherent states using linear optics and single-photon detection. Our demonstration uses coherent displacement operations based on interference, single-photon detection, and fast feedback to prepare the optimal feedback policy for the optimal non-projective quantum measurement with high fidelity. This generalized measurement allows us to transition among standard measurement paradigms in an optimal way from minimum error to unambiguous measurements for binary coherent states. As a particular case, we use this general measurement to implement the optimal minimum error measurement for phase-coherent states, which is the optimal modulation for communications under the average power constraint. Moreover, we propose a hybrid measurement that leverages the binary optimal inconclusive measurement in conjunction with sequential, unambiguous state elimination to realize higher dimensional inconclusive measurements of coherent states.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038/s41534-022-00595-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,18]],"date-time":"2022-07-18T11:03:02Z","timestamp":1658142182000},"update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Demonstration of optimal non-projective measurement of binary coherent states with photon counting","prefix":"10.1038","volume":"8","author":[{"given":"M.

In this paper, we consider conditions associated with\n``higher\" central charges, which have been introduced recently in\nthe math literature. In terms of these new obstructions, we identify\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a topological\nboundary in the case of bosonic, Abelian TQFTs, providing an alternative\nto the identification of a Lagrangian subgroup. Our proof relies on\ngeneral aspects of gauging generalized global symmetries.

It is conjectured that every anyon model, or mathematically unitary modular tensor category, can be realized as the representation category of some chiral conformal field theory, or mathematically vertex operator algebra/local conformal net. This conjecture is known to be true for abelian anyon models providing support for the conjecture. We reexamine abelian anyon models from several different angles. First anyon models are algebraic data for both topological quantum field theories and chiral conformal field theories. While it is known that each abelian anyon model can be realized by a quantum abelian Chern–Simons (CS) theory and chiral conformal field theory, the construction is not algorithmic. Our goal is to provide such an explicit algorithm for a <jats:italic>K</jats:italic>-matrix in CS theory and a positive definite even one for a lattice conformal field theory. Secondly anyon models and chiral conformal field theories underlie the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases of matter. But there are interesting subtleties in this correspondence when stability of the edge theory and topological symmetry are taken into consideration. Therefore, our focus is on the algorithmic reconstruction of extremal chiral conformal field theories with small central charges.

<jats:p>This chapter introduces the basic concepts of quantum information processing with superconducting quantum circuits. It starts with a demonstration of how,in these electrodynamic systems, both the superconducting gap and the long-range Coulomb interactions contribute to the existence of collective modesthat have extremely low dissipationand that can be quantized. The chapter also gives in-depth coverage of quantum harmonic oscillators in all their glory from various perspectives. Superconducting qubits are then introduced, starting with the fundamental theory of the Josephson effect and moving on to a presentation of the variety of existing superconducting qubits. Particular attention is given to the dispersive readout of qubits through their interaction with a cavity into which flying modes can be scattered. Finally, the opportunities offered for quantum information processing by employing the cavity as a quantum bus are presented.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199681181.003.0003","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,18]],"date-time":"2014-09-18T07:05:22Z","timestamp":1411023922000},"page":"113-256","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":22,"title":"Circuit QED: superconducting qubits coupled to microwave photons","prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"S.

Here we propose a cellular automaton decoder for a variation of the color code where the bases of the physical qubits are locally rotated, which we call the XYZ color code. The local transformation means our decoder demonstrates key properties of a two-dimensional fractal code if the noise acting on the system is infinitely biased towards dephasing, namely, no string-like logical operators. As such, in the high-bias limit, our local decoder reproduces the behavior of a partially self-correcting memory. At low error rates, our simulations show that the memory time diverges polynomially with system size without intervention from a global decoder, up to some critical system size that grows as the error rate is lowered. Furthermore, although we find that we cannot reproduce partially self-correcting behavior at finite bias, our numerics demonstrate improved memory times at realistic noise biases. Our results therefore motivate the design of tailored cellular automaton decoders that help to reduce the bandwidth demands of global decoding for realistic noise models.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.22331/q-2023-03-09-940","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,9]],"date-time":"2023-03-09T12:21:56Z","timestamp":1678364516000},"page":"940","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-crossmark-policy-page","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"A cellular automaton decoder for a noise-bias tailored color code","prefix":"10.22331","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"Jonathan F.

              <jats:p>The simulation of systems of interacting fermions is one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computers. The most interesting simulations will require a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and building such a device remains a long-term goal. However, the capabilities of existing noisy quantum processors have steadily improved, sparking an interest in running simulations that, while not necessarily classically intractable, may serve as device benchmarks and help elucidate the challenges to achieving practical applications on near-term devices. Systems of <jats:italic>non</jats:italic>-interacting fermions are ideally suited to serve these purposes. While they display rich physics and generate highly entangled states when simulated on a quantum processor, their classical tractability enables experimental results to be verified even at large system sizes that would typically defy classical simulation. In this work, we use a noisy superconducting quantum processor to prepare Majorana zero modes (MZMs) as eigenstates of the Kitaev chain Hamiltonian, a model of non-interacting fermions. Our work builds on previous experiments with non-interacting fermionic systems. Previous work demonstrated error mitigation techniques applicable to the special case of Slater determinants. Here, we show how to extend these techniques to the case of general fermionic Gaussian states, and demonstrate them by preparing MZMs on systems of up to seven qubits.</jats:p>","DOI":"10.1088/2058-9565/acb796","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,31]],"date-time":"2023-01-31T22:30:26Z","timestamp":1675204226000},"page":"025010","update-policy":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Simulating Majorana zero modes on a noisy quantum processor","prefix":"10.1088","volume":"8","author":[{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6459-6374","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Kevin J","family":"Sung","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4077-9744","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Marko J","family":"Rančić","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Olivia T","family":"Lanes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6731-6814","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Nicholas T","family":"Bronn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"266","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"reference":[],"container-title":"Quantum Science and Technology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796","content-type":"text/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"syndication"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"am","intended-application":"similarity-checking"},{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796/pdf","content-type":"application/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]],"date-time":"2023-02-09T13:27:13Z","timestamp":1675949233000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"references-count":41,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,1]]}},"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/acb796","relation":{},"ISSN":["2058-9565"],"subject":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics"],"container-title-short":"Quantum Sci.

We highlight that the denoising capabilities of quantum autoencoders are not limited to the protection of specific states but extend to the entire logical codespace. We also show that quantum neural networks can be used to discover new logical encodings that are optimally adapted to the underlying noise.

These models have shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena with no traditional analog, such as dynamical phase transitions in quantum systems that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more structured many-body dynamics. </jats:p>","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031720-030658","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,12]],"date-time":"2022-12-12T20:39:21Z","timestamp":1670877561000},"page":"335-379","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":"Random Quantum Circuits","prefix":"10.1146","volume":"14","author":[{"given":"Matthew P.A.","family":"Fisher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, USA;,"}]},{"given":"Vedika","family":"Khemani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA;"}]},{"given":"Adam","family":"Nahum","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratoire de Physique, École Normale Supérieure, CNRS, Université PSL, Sorbonne Université, Université de Paris, Paris, France;"}]},{"given":"Sagar","family":"Vijay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, California, USA;,"}]}],"member":"22","reference":[],"container-title":"Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031720-030658","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,10]],"date-time":"2023-03-10T23:37:12Z","timestamp":1678491432000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031720-030658"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,10]]},"references-count":311,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,10]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031720-030658"],"URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-031720-030658","relation":{},"ISSN":["1947-5454","1947-5462"],"subject":["Condensed Matter Physics","General Materials Science"],"container-title-short":"Annu.

In most QEC codes<jats:sup>2–8</jats:sup>, a logical qubit is encoded in some discrete variables, for example photon numbers, so that the encoded quantum information can be unambiguously extracted after processing. Over the past decade, repetitive QEC has been demonstrated with various discrete-variable-encoded scenarios<jats:sup>9–17</jats:sup>. However, extending the lifetimes of thus-encoded logical qubits beyond the best available physical qubit still remains elusive, which represents a break-even point for judging the practical usefulness of QEC.
