A code with all even-like (odd-like) codewords is called even-like (odd-like).\n\nDuadic code pairs can be defined in terms of their idempotent generators (see \\ref{topic:Cyclic-to-polynomial-correspondence}).\nA pair of even-like codes \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) with respective idempotents \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) is an \\textit{even-like duadic pair} if (1) \\(e_1(x)+e_2(x)=1-\\frac{1}{n}(1+x+x^2+\\cdots+x^{n-1})\\) and (2) there exists a multiplier \\(\\mu\\) such that \\(C_1 \\mu=C_2\\) and \\(C_2 \\mu=C_1\\).\n\nThere is an odd-like duadic pair \\(\\{D_1,D_2\\}\\) associated with the even-like pair \\(\\{C_1, C_2\\}\\), where \\(1-e_2(x)\\) generates \\(D_1\\) and \\(1-e_1(x)\\) generates \\(D_2\\). The even-pair codes are \\([n,\\frac{n-1}{2}]\\) codes while the odd-pair codes are \\([n,\\frac{n+1}{2}]\\) codes.\n","protection":"Since duadic codes are cyclic, the BCH bound can be used to determine their minimum distance.","notes":["Reviews of duadic codes \\cite{doi:10.1007/978-3-7091-2786-5_1,doi:10.1017/CBO9780511807077}."],"relations":{"parents":[{"code_id":"binary_cyclic"},{"code_id":"q-ary_duadic"}]},"_meta":{"changelog":[{"user_id":"VictorVAlbert","date":"2022-07-07"},{"user_id":"YijiaXu","date":"2022-04-25"}]},"_zoodb":{"id":"binary_duadic","source_file_path":"codes/classical/bits/cyclic/binary_duadic.yml","source_file_modification_token":"9e91d45b5a76640a44ade71706994d77a0b242c1f178b756d658e3a707071aaa","git_last_modified_date":"2024-03-15T20:44:31.000Z","flm_fields":["name","description","introduced","protection","notes.0","relations.parent_of.0.detail","relations.cousin_of.0.detail"]}},"binary_quad_residue":{"code_id":"binary_quad_residue","physical":"bits","logical":"bits","name":"Binary quadratic-residue (QR) code","short_name":"Binary QR","description":"Member of a quadruple of cyclic binary codes of prime length \\(n=8m\\pm 1\\) for \\(m\\geq 1\\) constructed using quadratic residues and nonresidues of \\(n\\).\n\nThe roots of the generator polynomial \\(r(x)\\) of the first code (see \\ref{topic:Cyclic-to-polynomial-correspondence}) are all of the inequivalent quadratic residues of \\(n\\), and the second code's generator polynomial is \\((x-1)r(x)\\).

The original motivation for evaluation codes, which are generalizations of RS codes that expand both the types of functions used as well as the available evaluation points, was to increase code length while maintaining good distance and size.\n\nThe algebraic curve \\(\\cal X\\) used for this construction is the set of zeroes of a nontrivial polynomial that is both smooth and irreducible over any field extension of \\(GF(q)\\). The curve can be defined over affine space or projective space, which contains the affine coordinates as a subset and which can yield an increase in length.\nIf evaluations are made over projective coordinates, then the codewords are evaluations of homogeneous polynomials, and there are relations between such polynomials with polynomials over affine space. See Refs. \\cite{preset:HPAlgCodes,doi:10.1007/978-3-319-51103-0} for more details.\n\nIn the case of polynomial functions \\(f\\), evaluation AG codes reduce to \\hyperref[code:evaluation_polynomial]{polynomial evaluation} codes on algebraic curves.

Attaching two of these via gluing together one logical leg from each can produce a \\( [[6,4,2]] \\) stabilizer code.\nCode optimization in this framework can be done using reinforcement learning \\cite{arxiv:2305.06378}.\n\nTo construct a Lego code, the encoding map \\(V\\) for each code that is to be used in the construction is converted to a tensor by decomposing it using the formula\n\\begin{align}\nV = \\sum_{i_j} V_{i_1 \\ldots i_{n+k}} | i_{k+1} \\ldots i_{k+n} \\rangle \\langle i_1 \\ldots i_k |~.\n\\end{align}\nWe then look at the codes graphically, treating each \\(i_j\\) as an edge dangling out of the tensor vertex \\(V_{i_1 \\ldots i_{n+k}}\\). These edges are either connected to another tensor vertex's edges or left dangling. If the block codes are stabilizer, then each local tensor has unitary product stabilizers (UPS). The goal is to push each UPS through the tensor network until each dangling edge has only trivial support. Otherwise, a matching value is pushed through the edge and the process is repeated on the next tensor. If a UPS can be pushed through the whole network, then a UPS for the larger network has been found. The dangling legs (edges) and UPS of the whole network can then be converted to physical/logical elements and stabilizers/logical operators for a new quantum code.\n","features":{"encoders":["Unitary-circuit encoding exists for a restricted class of tensor networks contractible via isometries \\cite{arxiv:2109.08158}."],"decoders":["The decoder is created by creating a decoding quantum circuit with dangling legs replaced with input/output wires, and tensors converted to unitary gates.

Haar-random codes are used to prove statements about the capacity of a quantum channel to transmit quantum information \\cite{arXiv:1106.1445}, but encoding and decoding in such \\(n\\)-qubit codes quickly becomes impractical as \\(n\\to\\infty\\).\n\nThere are different approaches to create Haar-random codewords. In the construction of Ref. \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0702005}, codewords are produced by performing a unitarily covariant projective measurement on a \\textit{typical} subspace of a tensor-power state. Reference \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0702005} showed that the capacity of a noisy quantum channel can be achieved by encoding in such Haar-random codes. In particular, Haar-random codes achieve perfect transmission in the \\(n\\to\\infty\\)) limit by proving that the encoded information becomes decoupled from the environment. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for successful decoding since measurements of the environment should never reveal the encoded information \\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/9604022}.\n\nIntuitively, coupling with the environment can be decreased by projecting the system onto a random codespace. The more qubits that are randomly discarded, the more the codespace is decoupled from the environment. One may ask what is the least amount of qubits that can be discarded, i.e. the largest remaining codespace, that still achieves decoupling. It can be shown through the decoupling inequality \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/0512247} that the largest possible dimension of the random codespace that achieves arbitrarily large decoupling is exponential in the coherent information of the channel. Therefore, there exist codes that can transmit information with rate equal to the coherent information. Furthermore, these codes can be constructed with high probability by performing a Haar-random isometry embedding a \\(k\\)-dimensional logical subspace into an \\(n\\)-dimensional physical space, where \\(k/n\\) is equal to the coherent information. Such an isometry can be produced by QR decomposition of a Gaussian random matrix \\cite{doi:10.1137/0717034}.\n","protection":"Random code achieve the capacity of any noisy quantum channel.","features":{"rate":"The rate of the code is equal to the coherent information of the channel (i.e. the quantum channel capacity).","threshold":["Haar-random qubit codes have a \\hyperref[topic:measurement-threshold]{measurement threshold} of one \\cite{arxiv:2402.00145}."]},"relations":{"parents":[{"code_id":"qubits_into_qubits"},{"code_id":"random_circuit"}],"cousins":[{"code_id":"t-designs","detail":"Approximating the random projections through \\(t\\)-designs is necessary in order to make the protocol practical.

instead of logical operators.\nThus the general formulae for the minimum distances \\(d, d_Z, d_X\\) for an \\([[n,k,d]]\\) or \\([[n,k,(d_X,d_Z)]]\\) \\(CSS(C_X, C_Z)\\) code

correspondence}\n\\label{topic:CSS-to-homology-correspondence}\nCSS codes and their properties can be formulated in terms of homology theory, yielding a powerful correspondence between codes and chain complexes, the primary homological structures.\nThere exists a many-to-one mapping from size three chain complexes to CSS codes \\cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,arXiv:quant-ph/0605094,arXiv:1311.0885,arXiv:1802.01520} that allows one to extract code properties from topological features of the complexes.\nCodes constructed in this manner are sometimes called \\textit{homological CSS codes}, but they are equivalent to CSS codes.\nThis mapping of codes to manifolds allows the application of structures from topology to error correction, yielding \\hyperref[code:generalized_homological_product]{various QLDPC codes} with favorable properties.\n\\end{defterm}\n\nA \\textit{chain complex} of size three is given by binary vector spaces \\(A_2\\), \\(A_1\\), \\(A_0\\) and binary matrices \\(\\partial_{i=1,2}\\) (called \\textit{boundary operators}) \\(A_i\\) to \\(A_{i-1}\\) that satisfy \\(\\partial_1 \\partial_2 = 0\\). Such a complex is typically denoted as\n\\begin{align}\nA_2 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_2} A_1 \\xrightarrow{\\partial_1} A_0~.\n\\label{eq:chain}\n\\end{align}\nOne constructs a CSS code by associating a physical qubit to every basis element of \\(A_1\\), and defining parity-check matrices \\(H_X=\\partial_1\\) and \\(H_Z=\\partial_2^T\\)). That way, the spaces \\(A_0\\) and \\(A_2\\) can be associated with \\(X\\)-type and \\(Z\\)-type Pauli operators, respectively, and boundary operators determine the Paulis making up the stabilizer generators. The requirement \\(\\partial_1 \\partial_2 = 0\\) guarantees that the \\(X\\)-stabilizer generators associated with \\(H_X\\) commute with the \\(Z\\)-stabilizer generators associated with \\(H_Z\\).\n\nUsually, the chain complex \\eqref{eq:chain} used in the construction comes from the chain complex associated with a cellulation of a manifold. When the manifold is a two-dimensional surface, its entire chain is used. Higher-dimensional manifolds allow for longer chain complexes, and one can use the three largest non-trivial vector spaces in its chain.\n\nCSS codes saturate a type of \\textit{error correction uncertainty relation} \\cite[Thm. 3]{doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.793}, which is a special case of an entropic uncertainty relation between a pair of bases \\cite{doi:10.1007/BF01608825,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.50.631,doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.1103}.\nThe code state \\(\\sum_{c\\in C_{Z}}|c\\rangle\\) can be expressed in terms of either basis states labeled by the code \\(C_{Z}\\) or its dual, satisfying, with equality, the relation\n\\begin{align}\n  |C_{Z}||C_{Z}^{\\perp}| \\geq 2^{n}\\,.\n\\end{align}\n","protection":"Detects errors on \\(d-1\\) qubits, corrects errors on \\(\\left\\lfloor (d-1)/2 \\right\\rfloor\\) qubits.\n\nUsing the relation to chain complexes, the number of encoded logical qubits is equal to the dimension of the first \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)-homology of the chain complex, \\(H_1(\\partial, \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\frac{\\text{Ker}(\\partial_1)}{\\text{Im}(\\partial_2)}\\).\n\nThe distance of the CSS code is equal to the minimum of the combinatorial (\\(d-1\\))-systole of the cellulated \\(d\\)-dimensional manifold and its dual.\n\nCSS codes have a \\textit{CSS lower bound} against depolarizing noise because CSS decoding does not take into account correlations between \\(X\\)- and \\(Z\\)-type noise \\cite{doi:10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620358}.\n","features":{"rate":"For a depolarizing channel with probability \\(p\\), CSS codes allowing for arbitrarily accurate recovery exist with asymptotic rate \\(1-2h(p)\\), where \\(h\\) is the binary entropy function \\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143}.","encoders":["Stabilizer measurement \\cite{arxiv:1404.2495}.","Clusterization, i.e., measurement of a particular cluster state \\cite{arxiv:1607.02579}.","Entanglement purification \\cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0210069}."],"transversal_gates":"All CSS codes admit transversal Pauli and CNOT gates \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9605011}.\nSelf-dual CSS codes admit a transversal Hadamard gate.\nRealizing transversal gates outside of the Clifford group requires certain higher-order (i.e., non-quadratic) constraints to be satisfied on the code \\cite{arxiv:1209.2426} (see \\hyperref[code:quantum_divisible]{quantum divisible} codes).'\n","general_gates":["LDPC CSS code symmetries called \\(XZ\\)-dualities allow for fold-transversal gates, i.e., transversal gates followed by qubit permutations \\cite{arxiv:2202.06647}.","Generalized lattice surgery \\cite{arxiv:2301.13738}."],"fault_tolerance":["Steane error correction \\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9611027}, where fault-tolerance is ensured by preparing ancillary encoded states and extracting syndromes via \\(CNOT\\) gates.","Homomorphic gadgets fault-tolerant measurement unify Steane and Shor error correction \\cite{arxiv:2211.03625}.","Parallel syndrome extraction for distance-three codes can be done fault-tolerantly using one flag qubit \\cite{arXiv:2208.00581}.","Distance-preserving flag fault-tolerant error correction using lookup tables for small codes \\cite{arxiv:2306.12862}.","A fault-tolerant error-correction protocol using \\(O(d\\log d)\\) syndrome measurements can be applied to any CSS code with distance \\(d \\geq \\Omega(n^{\\alpha})\\) for any \\(\\alpha > 0\\) \\cite{arxiv:2002.05180}.","Fault-tolerant measurement-free scheme for low-distance CSS codes \\cite{arxiv:2307.13296}."],"code_capacity_threshold":["Bounds on code capacity thresholds for various noise models exist in terms of stabilizer generator weights \\cite{arxiv:1208.2317,arxiv:1412.6172}."],"decoders":["Coherent decoders allow for measurement-free error correction \\cite{arxiv:2109.00086}.
